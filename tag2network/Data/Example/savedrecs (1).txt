The 'hygiene hypothesis' has also proposed that decreased childhood exposure to pathogen-derived T(H)1 cytokines may underlie the recent increased prevalence of asthma, a T(H)2-mediated disease. We show here that influenza A viral infection, which induces large amounts of intrapulmonary IFN-gamma production, unexpectedly enhanced later allergen-specific asthma and promoted dual allergen-specific T(H)1 and T(H)2 responses. Pulmonary dendritic cells obtained from the lung after viral clearance and resolution of acute inflammation conferred enhanced allergic disease and concurrent T(H)1 and T(H)2 immune responses, and these effects were dependent on IFN-gamma secreted during the acute viral infection. Thus, respiratory viral infection and the acute T(H)1 response can positively regulate T(H)2-dependent allergic pulmonary disease in vivo, at least in part, by altering pulmonary dendritic cell function.

In sensitized animals AIC can stimulate an Amb a 1-specific T(H)1 response and decrease pulmonary reactivity to ragweed challenge. Clinical trials have documented reduced allergic response to AIC in comparison with licensed ragweed extract. Objectives: We sought to determine the in vivo effect,of shortcourse immunotherapy with AIC on eosinophilia and cytokine mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of ragweed-sensitive patients. Methods: Ragweed-sensitive patients with allergic rhinitis were treated with 6 escalating doses of AIC (0.06-12 mug, n 28) or placebo (n = 29) at weekly intervals immediately before the 2001 ragweed season. Symptom scores and medication use were recorded for the 2001 and 2002 ragweed seasons for all patients. A subset of patients (12 receiving AIC and 7 receiving placebo) consented to have nasal biopsy specimens taken before immunization and before and after the first ragweed season. The preseason and postseason biopsy specimens were taken 24 hours after ragweed allergen challenge and compared with the initial unchallenged biopsy specimen to assess cytokine and inflammatory cell responses by using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results: AIC was safe and well tolerated by all patients. There was no difference between the AIC and placebo groups in the number of allergen-induced major basic protein-, IL-4-, IL-5-, or IFN-gamma-positive cells in the mucosa in the first weeksafter AIC immunization. On rechallenge and rebiopsy after the end of the 2001 ragweed season, however, AIC-treated patients had a significantly reduced increase in eosinophils and IL-4 mRNA-positive cells and an increased number of IFN-gamma mRNA-positive cells compared with placebo-treated patients. No difference between treatment groups was observed in symptom scores or medication use during the first ragweed season. During the second ragweed season, however, there was a significant decrease in chest symptoms and a trend toward reduced nasal symptoms in the AIC-treated group. Conclusion: Short-course immunotherapy with AIC can modify the response of nasal mucosa to allergen challenge by increasing T(H)1 cytokine production and decreasing T(H)2 cytokine production and eosinophilia. This modification was not immediate but was observed 4 to 5 months after completion of immunotherapy and seasonal ragweed-pollen exposure. The T-cell subset shift after immunization and seasonal exposure was followed by evidence of clinical efficacy in the second ragweed season without additional AIC immunizations.

Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with atopic asthma and normal subjects were exposed to live or inactivated RV preparations. Levels of interferon (IFN)gamma and interleukins IL-12, IL-10, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were evaluated in the culture supernatants with specific immunoassays. Results: Exposure of PBMC to RVs induced the production of IFNgamma, IL-12, IL-10, and IL-13. Cells from asthmatic subjects produced significantly lower levels of IFNgamma and IL-12 and higher levels of IL-10 than normal subjects. IL-4 was induced only in the asthmatic group, while the IFNgamma/IL-4 ratio was more than three times lower in the asthmatic group. Conclusions: This evidence suggests that the immune response to RVs is not uniquely of a type 1 phenotype, as previously suggested. The type 1 response is defective in atopic asthmatic individuals, with a shift towards a type 2 phenotype in a way similar, but not identical, to their aberrant response to allergens. A defective type 1 immune response to RVs may be implicated in the pathogenesis of virus induced exacerbations of asthma.

We conducted a Canadian multicenter population-based incident, case (n = 517)-control (n = 1506) study among men in a diversity of occupations using an initial postal questionnaire followed by a telephone interview for those reporting pesticide exposure of 10 h/year or more, and a 15% random sample of the remainder. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were computed using conditional logistic regression stratified by the matching variables of age and province of residence, and subsequently adjusted for statistically significant medical variables (history of measles, mumps, cancer, allergy desensitization treatment, and a positive history of cancer in first-degree relatives). We found that among major chemical classes of herbicides, the risk of NHL was statistically significantly increased by exposure to phenoxyherbicides [OR, 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.81] and to dicamba (OR, 1.88; 95% Cl, 1.32-2.68). Exposure to carbamate (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22-3.04) and to organophosphorus insecticides (OR, 1.73; 95% Cl, 1.27-2.36), amide fungicides, and the fumigant carbon tetrachloride (OR, 2.42; 95% Cl, 1.19-5.14) statistically significantly increased risk. Among individual compounds, in multivariate analyses, the risk of NHL was statistically significantly increased by exposure to the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; OR, 1.32; 95% CL 1.01-1.73), mecoprop (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.58-3.44), and dicamba (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.00-2.81); to the insecticides malathion (OR, 1.83; 95% Cl, 1.31-2.55), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), carbaryl (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.21-3.69), aldrin, and lindane; and to the fungicides captan and sulfur compounds. In additional multivariate models, which included exposure to other major chemical classes or individual pesticides, personal antecedent cancer, a history of cancer among first-degree relatives, and exposure to mixtures containing dicamba (OR, 1.96; 95% CL 1.40-2.75) or to mecoprop (OR, 2.22; 95% CL 1.49-3.29) and to aldrin (OR, 3.42; 95% Cl, 1.18-9.95) were significant independent predictors of an increased risk for NHL, whereas a personal history of measles and of allergy desensitization treatments lowered the risk.

Evidence of a Causal Role of Winter Virus Infection during Infancy in Early Childhood Asthma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						asthma; respiratory winter virus infection; timing of birth	RESPIRATORY-SYNCYTIAL-VIRUS; VIRAL-INFECTIONS; LUNG-DISEASE; RISK-FACTORS; BRONCHIOLITIS; AGE; CHILDREN; ALLERGY; BIRTH; PATHOGENESIS	Rationale: Bronchiolitis during infancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Whether winter viral infections cause asthma or are a manifestation of a predisposition to asthma development is unknown. Objectives: To study the relationship of winter virus infection during infancy and the development of childhood asthma. Methods: We studied over 95,000 infants born between 1995 and 2000 and followed through 2005 who were enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from birth through early childhood to determine whether infant birth in relationship to the wintervirus peak alters the risk of developing early childhood asthma. Measurements and Main Results: Among 95,310 children studied during five winter virus seasons from birth through early childhood, the risk of developing asthma tracked with the timing of infant birth in relationship to the winter virus peak. Infant birth approximately 4 months before the winter virus peak carried the highest risk, with a 29% increase in odds of developing asthma compared with birth 12 months before the peak (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.40). Infant age at the winter virus peak was comparable to or greater than other known risk factors for asthma. Conclusions: Timing of birth in relationship to winter virus season confers a differential and definable risk of developing early childhood asthma, establishing winter virus seasonality as a causal factor in asthma development. Delay of exposure or prevention of winter viral infection during early infancy could prevent asthma.

Objective: To determine the impact of food allergy on the daily activities of food allergic children and their families. Methods: Caregivers of food allergic children from a university-based allergy practice completed a questionnaire that evaluated their perception of the impact of their child's food allergy on family activities. Results: Of the 87 families who completed the study, more than 60% of caregivers reported that food allergy significantly affected meal preparation and 49% or more indicated that food allergy affected family social activities. Forty-one percent of parents reported a significant impact on their stress levels and 34% reported that food allergy had an impact on school attendance, with 10% choosing to home school their children because of food allergy. The number of food allergies had a significant impact on activity scores, but the existence of comorbid conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis did not significantly affect the results. Conclusions: Food allergy has a significant effect on activities of families of food allergic children. Further study is needed to determine more detailed effects of food allergy on parent-child interactions and development.

Therefore, a multi-centre, randomized dose-response trial, double-blind with respect to the efficacy of a biologically standardized depot house dust mite preparation was performed. Methods: Eighty-nine adults with a chronic course of atopic dermatitis, SCORAD >= 40 and allergic sensitization to house dust mites [CAP-FEIA >= 3] were included, of whom 51 completed the study. Subcutaneous SIT with a house dust mite preparation (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus/D. farinae) applying maintenance doses of 20, 2000 and 20 000 SQ-U in weekly intervals for 1 year. The main outcome measures addressed the change of the SCORAD as average of the values after 9 and 12 months of SIT in comparison with the value at baseline. Results: The SCORAD declined in the three dose groups in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.0368, Jonckheere-Terpstra test) and was significantly lower in the two high-dose groups (2000, 20000 SQ-U) compared with the low-dose group of 20 SQ-U (P = 0.0379, U-test) after 1 year of SIT. The use of topical corticosteroids was significantly reduced with higher doses (P = 0.0007, Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test). Conclusions: Allergen-SIT for 1 year with a house dust mite preparation is able to improve the eczema in patients with atopic dermatitis who are sensitized to house dust mite allergens and reduces the need for topical corticosteroids. SIT may be valuable in the treatment of this chronic skin disease.

Functionally, two isoforms of this enzyme exist: constitutive and inducible. The former seems to protect airways from excessive bronchoconstriction while the latter has a modulatory role in inflammatory disorders of the airways such as asthma. This review explores the physiological and pathophysiological role of endogenous nitric oxide in the airways, and the clinical aspects of monitoring nitric oxide in exhaled air of patients with respiratory disease.

Yet these cannot be measured directly in clinical research and practice because of the difficulties in monitoring inflammation. Noninvasive monitoring may assist in early recognition of asthma and COPD, assessment of its severity, and response to treatment, especially during disease exacerbations. There is increasing evidence that breath analysis may have an important place in clinical management of asthma and COPD. The article reviews the role of current noninvasive measurements of exhaled gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), and exhaled breath temperature, as wen as novel methods in monitoring and management of asthma and COPD.

Objective: This study examined asthma symptoms, health care use, and management in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey, followed by administration of a questionnaire in a face-to-face setting in the respondents' homes in their language of choice. Urban centers in 8 areas were surveyed: China, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Results: A population sample of 3207 respondents with physician-diagnosed asthma was identified by screening 108,360 households. Daytime asthma symptoms were reported by 51.4% of respondents, and 44.3% reported sleep disturbance caused by asthma in the preceding 4 weeks. At least 2 in every 5 respondents (43.6%) had been hospitalized, attended a hospital emergency department, or made unscheduled emergency visits to other health care facilities for treatment of asthma during the previous 12 months. Overall, 15.3% of respondents reported that they had required admission to the hospital for asthma treatment. Asthma severity correlated with the frequencies of hospitalizations and emergency visits for asthma in the past year. Even in those patients with severe persistent asthma, 34.3% regarded their disease as being well or completely controlled. Current use of an inhaled corticosteroid was reported by only 13.6% of respondents, and 56.3% used quick-relief bronchodilators. Absence from school and work in the past year was reported by 36.5 % of children and 26.5 % of adults. Conclusion: As reported for other regions, current levels of asthma control in the Asia-Pacific region fall markedly short of goals specified in international guidelines for asthma management.

Number concentrations of ultrafine particles, 0.01-0.1 mum in diameter (NC0.01-0.1), mean 17,300.cm(-3), and mass concentrations of fine particles 0.01-2.5 mum in diameter (MC0.01-2.5), mean 30.3 mug.m(-3), were measured concurrently. They were not highly correlated (r=0.45). The associations between ambient particle concentrations and the prevalence of inhaled beta(2)-agonist, corticosteroid use and asthma symptoms, were analysed separately with logistic regression models, adjusting for trend, temperature, weekend, holidays, and first order autocorrelation of the error. Cumulative exposures over 14 days of ultrafine and fine particles were associated with corticosteroid use. beta(2)-agonist use was associated with 5-day mean NC0.01-0.1 and MC0.01-2.5. The prevalence of asthma symptoms was associated with ambient particle concentrations. The results suggest that reported asthma medication use and symptoms increase in association with particulate air pollution and gaseous pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide.

The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host barrier: these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system. Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation. Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease. food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease., and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.

We estimated associations between early-life exposure to pets and atopy-related diseases at 0-4 years of life in a cohort of Norwegian children. Methods: A population-based cohort of 2531 children born in Oslo, Norway, was followed from birth to the age of 4 years. Information on early-life exposure to pets, a number of possible confounders, and atopy-related diseases was mainly collected by questionnaire. Results: In logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio for being exposed to pets in early life (reference category: not exposed) was, for bronchial obstruction at 0-2 years of life, 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.9, 1.8); for asthma at the age of 4 years, 0.7 (0.5, 1.1); for allergic rhinitis at the age of 4 years, 0.6 (0.4, 1.0); and for atopic eczema at 0-6 months of life, 0.7 (0.5, 0.9). Conclusions: The results indicate that early-life exposure to pets or lifestyle factors associated with, exposure to pets reduce the risk of developing atopy-related diseases in early childhood. However, these findings might also be explained by selection for keeping pets.

The estimated relative risk for particulate matter less than or equal to 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) was 1.04 per 15 mu g/m(3) (p < 0.05). Exposure-response trends (p < 0.01) were observed for ozone (>100 ppb vs. <50 ppb: odds ratio = 1.23, p = 0.003) and PM10 (>60 mu g/m(3) vs. <20 mu g/m(3): odds ratio = 1.26, p = 0.004). In models with ozone and PM10, both terms became nonsignificant because of collinearity of the variables (r = 0.75), The other analytical approaches yielded consistent findings. This study supports accumulating evidence regarding the relation of air pollution to childhood asthma exacerbation.

Reduction in sputum neutrophil and eosinophil numbers by the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast in patients with COPD	THORAX			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIR-FLOW LIMITATION; PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITOR; LUNG-FUNCTION; SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION; ASTHMA; METAANALYSIS; FLUTICASONE; PROPIONATE; MODULATION	Background: Roflumilast is a targeted oral once-daily administered phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor with clinical efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results from in vitro studies with roflumilast indicate that it has anti-inflammatory properties that may be applicable for the treatment of COPD. Methods: In a crossover study, 38 patients with COPD (mean (SD) age 63.1 (7.0) years, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 61.0 (12.6)% predicted) received 500 mu g roflumilast or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Induced sputum samples were collected before and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Differential and absolute cell counts were determined in whole sputum samples. Markers of inflammation were determined in sputum supernatants and blood. Spirometry was performed weekly. Results: Roflumilast significantly reduced the absolute number of neutrophils and eosinophils/g sputum compared with placebo by 35.5% (95% CI 15.6% to 50.7%; p = 0.002) and 50.0% (95% CI 26.8% to 65.8%; p<0.001), respectively. The relative proportion of sputum neutrophils and eosinophils was not affected by treatment (p>0.05). Levels of soluble interleukin-8, neutrophil elastase, eosinophil cationic protein and alpha(2)-macroglobulin in sputum and the release of tumour necrosis factor alpha from blood cells were significantly reduced by roflumilast compared with placebo treatment (p<0.05 for all). Post-bronchodilator FEV1 improved significantly during roflumilast compared with placebo treatment with a mean difference between treatments of 68.7 ml (95% CI 12.9 to 124.5; p = 0.018). Conclusion: PDE4 inhibition by roflumilast treatment for 4 weeks reduced the number of neutrophils and eosinophils, as well as soluble markers of neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammatory activity in induced sputum samples of patients with COPD. This anti-inflammatory effect may in part explain the concomitant improvement in post-bronchodilator FEV1.

For adequate prevention it is important not only to identify risk factors, but also possible protective factors. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of allergic diseases and sensitization between farm children, children in anthroposophic families, and reference children, with the aim to identify factors that may protect against allergic disease. Methods: The study was of cross-sectional design and included 14 893 children, aged 5-13 years, from farm families, anthroposophic families (recruited from Steiner schools) and reference children in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. A detailed questionnaire was completed and allergen-specific IgE was measured in blood. Results: Growing up on a farm was found to have a protective effect against all outcomes studied, both self-reported, such as rhinoconjunctivitis, wheezing, atopic eczema and asthma and sensitization (allergen specific IgE >= 0.35 kU/l). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for current rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.65) and for atopic sensitization 0.53 (95% CI 0.42-0.67) for the farm children compared to their references. The prevalence of allergic symptoms and sensitization was also lower among Steiner school children compared to reference children, but the difference was less pronounced and not as consistent between countries, adjusted OR for current rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms was 0.69 (95% CI 0.56-0.86) and for atopic sensitization 0.73 (95% CI 0.58-0.92). Conclusions: This study indicates that growing up on a farm, and to a lesser extent leading an anthroposophic life style may confer protection from both sensitization and allergic diseases in childhood.

However, despite distinctive physiologic features at the time of diagnosis, and different risk factors, the two diseases over time may develop features that are quite similar. Study objective: To evaluate the association between physician-diagnosed asthma and the subsequent development of COPD in a cohort of 3,099 adult subjects from Tucson, AZ. Design and methods: A prospective observational study. Participants completed up to 12 standard respiratory questionnaires and 11 spirometry lung function measurements over a period of 20 years. Survival curves (with time to development of COPD as the dependent variable) were compared between subjects with asthma and subjects without asthma at the initial survey. Results: Subjects with active asthma (n = 192) had significantly higher hazard ratios than inactive (n = 156) or nonasthmatic subjects (n = 2751) for acquiring COPD. As compared with nonasthmatics, active asthmatics had a 10-times-higher risk for acquiring symptoms of chronic bronchitis (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.94 to 20.25), 17-times-higher risk of receiving a diagnosis of emphysema (95% CI, 8.31 to 34.83), and 12.5-times-higher risk of fulfilling COPD criteria (95% CI, 6.84 to 22.84), even after adjusting for smoking history and other potential confounders. Conclusions: Physician-diagnosed asthma is significantly associated with an increased risk for CB, emphysema, and COPD.

Objective: This study was designed to determine whether the clinical courses of patients with AERD improved as early as 6 months after starting aspirin desensitization and to compare this with follow-up evaluations after at least a year. Methods: Between 1995 and 2000, 172 patients with AERD were admitted to our General Clinical Research Center, were desensitized to and treated with aspirin, were discharged to their home communities, and participated in follow-up interviews and written assessments of their clinical courses. Results: By the first 6 months of aspirin treatment, there were significant reductions in sinus infections and numbers of short courses of prednisone and improvements in sense of smell and general assessment of nasal-sinus and asthma symptoms (P <.0001). These results persisted for I to 5 years (P <.0001). Mean prednisone doses decreased from 10.8 mg/d to 8.1 and 3.6 mg/d at 6 months and greater than 1 year, respectively. Of the 172 patients, 24 (14%) discontinued aspirin treatment because of side effects, and 115 (67%) responded to aspirin treatment. After eliminating those who discontinued aspirin treatment because of side effects, the improvement rate was 115 (78%) of 148 patients. Of the 126 patients who completed a year or more of aspirin treatment, 110 (87%) experienced improvement. Conclusion: Aspirin desensitization followed by daily aspirin is efficacious by at least the first 6 months of treatment and continues to be effective for up to 5 years of follow-up.

Because the asthmatic bronchial epithelium is characteristically damaged with loss of columnar epithelial cells, we postulated that this is due to unscheduled apoptosis. Using an antibody directed toward the caspase cleavage product of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, immunohistochemistry applied to endobronchial biopsies showed higher levels of staining in the bronchial epithelium of subjects with asthma as compared with normal control subjects (% epithelial staining [median (range) = 10.5 (1.4-24.5) versus 0.4 (0.0-9.7)]; P < 0.001). Because we were unable to determine whether this difference was due to ongoing inflammation in vivo, cultures of normal and asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells were used to study apoptosis in vitro. In complete growth medium, these cells showed no difference in their rate of proliferation or viability. However, cells from subjects with asthma were more susceptible to the apoptotic effects of H2O2 than cells from normal control subjects (% apoptotic cells = 32.2 [8.8-54.9] versus 14.3 [6.4-24.7]; P < 0.05), even though both were similarly affected by treatment with actinomycin D. These data indicate that the susceptibility of asthmatic bronchial epithelium to oxidants is greater than normal. This susceptibility may contribute to the rising trends in asthma associated with air pollution and diets low in antioxidants.

Using multimers of I-A(d) molecules bound to a LACK peptide as probes, we tracked the migration of LACK-specific Th2 cells to the airways. Elevated numbers of LACK-specific Th2 cells remained in the airways for 5 weeks after the last aerosol. Substantial numbers of DC presenting LACK peptides were found in the airways, but not in other compartments, for up to 8 weeks after antigen exposure.

The only truly effective treatment is early recognition and control of exposure. Although patients produce antibody exuberantly, the immunopathogenesis involves cellular immunity-notably, CD8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes, multinucleate giant cell granulomas, and ultimately interstitial fibrosis. Many causative agents have been recognized in occupational dusts or mists, but most current new cases arise from residential exposure to pet birds (pigeons and parakeets), contaminated humidifiers, and indoor molds. The symptoms and physical findings are nonspecific. Serum IgG containing high titers of specific antibody to the offending antigen is elevated, Pulmonary function tests show restrictive and diffusion defects with hypoxemia, especially after exercise. Occasionally, small airways disease causes obstruction. Radiographic changes vary according to the stage of the disease and are best evaluated by means of high-resolution computed tomography. In typical cases, the history of a known exposure and the presence of a characteristic interstitial lung disease with serologic confirmation of IgG antibody to the offending antigen suffice for diagnosis. In more obscure cases, observation of changes after a natural environmental exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy might be indicated. Among the many questions that remain are the following: What is the prevalence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and how often is it the cause of chronic interstitial fibrosis? What is the long-term prognosis? Why do most individuals exposed to these antigens develop a vigorous antibody response whereas only a few develop the disease? How does exposure to endotoxin and cigarette smoking affect the disease? To answer these questions, standardized and validated clinical laboratory immunochemical tests are needed, in addition to a systematic approach to diagnosis, classification of disease severity, risk assessment, and management. This review is limited to the disease caused by airborne allergens and focuses on its immunopathogenesis, eliciting agents, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis.

Evidence Report Data Sources: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, bibliographies of selected reviews, and suggestions from domain experts were surveyed. Searches were limited to English-language publications. Evidence Report Review Methods: Eligible comparisons examined the association between differential exposure to breastfeeding and health outcomes. We assessed 15 infant and six maternal outcomes. For four outcomes, we also updated previously published systematic reviews. For the rest of the outcomes, we either summarized previous systematic reviews or conducted new systematic reviews; randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, prospective cohorts, and case-control studies were included. Adjusted estimates were extracted from non-experimental designs. The studies were graded for methodological quality. We did not draw conclusions from poor quality studies. Evidence Report Results: We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Thirty-two primary studies on term infant health outcomes, 43 primary studies on maternal health outcomes, and 28 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that covered approximately 400 individual studies were included in this review. A history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. There were insufficient good quality data to address the relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases and infant mortality. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-prepregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear. Evidence Report Conclusions: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers. Future research would benefit from clearer selection criteria, definitions of breastfeeding exposure, and adjustment for potential confounders. Matched designs such as sibling analysis may provide a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the association between asthma onset in children and traffic-related air pollution. METHODS: We selected a sample of 217 children from participants in the Southern California Children's Health Study, a prospective cohort designed to investigate associations between air pollution and respiratory health in children 10-18 years of age. Individual covariates and new asthma incidence (30 cases) were reported annually through questionnaires during 8 years of follow-up. Children had nitrogen dioxide monitors placed outside their home for 2 weeks in the summer and 2 weeks in the fall-winter season as a marker of traffic-related air pollution. We used multilevel Cox models to test the associations between asthma and air pollution. RESULTS: In models controlling for confounders, incident asthma was positively associated with traffic Pollution, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.56] across the average within-community interquartille range of 6.2 ppb in annual residential NO(2). Using the total interquartile range for all measurements of 28.9 ppb increased the HR to 3.25 (95% CI, 1.35-7.85). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, markers of traffic-related air pollution were associated with the onset of asthma. The risks observed suggest that air pollution exposure contributes to new-onset asthma.

However, methodological limitations in the studies make conclusions uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the association between fish consumption during the first year of life and development of allergic diseases by age 4. Methods: A prospective birth cohort of 4089 new-born infants was followed for 4 years using parental questionnaires at ages 2 months, 1, 2 and 4 years to collect information on exposure and health effects. The response rate at 4 years was 90%. A clinical investigation was performed at age 4 years, which included blood sampling for analysis of specific IgE to common food and airborne allergens. Results: Parental allergic disease and onset of eczema or wheeze during the first year of life delayed introduction of fish in the child's diet. After exclusion of such children to avoid disease-related modification of exposure, regular fish consumption during the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk for allergic disease by age 4, ORadj 0.76 (95% CI 0.61-0.94) and sensitization, ORadj 0.76 (0.58-1.0). The reduced risk appeared most pronounced for multiple disease, ORadj 0.56 (0.35-0.89). IgE-sensitization to fish was only present among 18 of the 2614 children. Conclusion: Regular fish consumption before age 1 appears to be associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease and sensitization to food and inhalant allergens during the first 4 years of life.

A replication intermediate of RSV is dsRNA. This is an important ligand for both the innate immune receptor, TLR3, and protein kinase R (PKR). One known effect of RSV infection is the increased responsiveness of airway epithelial cells to subsequent bacterial ligands (i.e., LPS). In this study, we examined a possible role for RSV infection in increasing amounts and responsiveness of another TLR, TLR3. These studies demonstrate that RSV infection of A549 and human tracheobronchial epithelial cells increases the amounts of TLR3 and PKR in a time-dependent manner. This leads to increased NF-kappa B activity and production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-8 following a later exposure to dsRNA. Importantly, TLR3 was not detected on the cell surface at baseline but was detected on the cell surface after RSV infection. The data demonstrate that RSV, via an effect on TLR3 and PKR, sensitizes airway epithelial cells to subsequent dsRNA exposure. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that RSV infection sensitizes the airway epithelium to subsequent viral and bacterial exposures by up-regulating TLRs and increasing their membrane localization.

The aim of the study was to investigate how often such difficult-to-treat asthma is due to intractable asthma, misdiagnosis, non-adherence with therapy, or psychiatric problems. Difficult asthma was defined as persistence of symptoms despite treatment at step 4 of British guidelines or requirement for long-term oral glucocorticoids (step 5). One-hundred patients with a respiratory physician diagnosis of asthma were investigated in a single tertiary respiratory unit in an open and descriptive study. Twelve of the patients studied did not have asthma and a further seven had additional diagnoses. Of the remainder, 55 had an asthma diagnosis confirmed by demonstration of reversible airflow narrowing or peak flow variability, whilst 20 did not. Noncompliance with prednisolone therapy was more frequent in the 55 with confirmed asthma (nine of 18 prescribed oral prednisolone at a dose of greater than or equal to 15 mg(.)day(-1)) and was not detected in the "unconfirmed asthma" group. There were no other significant differences between these groups. A major psychiatric component was detected in 10 patients. Systematic evaluation of difficult asthma is useful as it can identify alternative or additional diagnoses, psychiatric illness or nonconcordance with therapy in a substantial proportion of cases (32% in the present series).

In airway inflammation, NO is not merely a marker but may have antiinflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects, Significant correlation has been found between exhaled NO and skin test scores in steroid naive asthmatic patients, allowing to discriminate patients with and without airway responsiveness. Exhaled NO is significantly elevated in acute asthma, or steroid-resistant severe asthma, or when the maintenance dose of inhaled steroids is reduced, and quickly reduced down to the levels in patients with stable asthma after steroid treatment. Exhaled NO has been successfully used to monitor anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma, Exhaled NO is extremely sensitive and rapid marker of the dose-dependent effect of steroid treatment, or asthma deterioration, which is increased to any changes in lung function, provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume, sputum eosinophilia or asthma symptoms. Exhaled NO is not increased in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but patients with unstable COPD, or bronchiectasis have high NO levels. Exhaled and nasal NO are diagnostically low in cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary dyskinesia. Analysis of exhaled air, including nitric oxide, is feasible and could provide a noninvasive method for use in monitoring and management of lung diseases.

The existing literature contains moderate to strong evidence that characteristics of buildings and indoor environments significantly influence rates of communicable respiratory illness, allergy and asthma symptoms, sick building symptoms, and worker performance. Whereas there is considerable uncertainty in the estimates of the magnitudes of productivity gains that may be obtained by providing better indoor environments, the projected gains are very large. For the United States, the estimated potential annual savings and productivity gains are $6 to $14 billion from reduced respiratory disease, $1 to $4 billion from reduced allergies and asthma, $10 to $30 billion from reduced sick building syndrome symptoms, and $20 to $160 billion from direct improvements in worker performance that are unrelated to health. Productivity gains that are quantified and demonstrated could serve as a strong stimulus for energy efficiency measures that simultaneously improve the indoor environment.

In this study, we have addressed the involvement of IL-1 in the interaction between HDM and the innate immune response driven by lung epithelial cells (ECs) and dendritic cells (DCs) that leads to asthma. Mice lacking IL-1R on radioresistant cells, but not hematopoietic cells, failed to mount a Th2 immune response and did not develop asthma to HDM. Experiments performed in vivo and in isolated air-liquid interface cultures of bronchial ECs showed that TLR4 signals induced the release of IL-1 alpha, which then acted in an autocrine manner to trigger the release of DC-attracting chemokines, GM-CSF, and IL-33. Consequently, allergic sensitization to HDM was abolished in vivo when IL-1 alpha, GM-CSF, or IL-33 was neutralized. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) became important only when high doses of allergen were administered.

Smoke-free Legislation and Hospitalizations for Childhood Asthma.	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY; SECONDHAND SMOKE; 2ND-HAND SMOKE; EXPOSURE; SCOTLAND; IMPLEMENTATION; CHILDREN; HEALTH	Background: Previous studies have shown that after the adoption of comprehensive smoke-free legislation, there is a reduction in respiratory symptoms among workers in bars. However, it is not known whether respiratory disease is also reduced among people who do not have occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. The aim of our study was to determine whether the ban on smoking in public places in Scotland, which was initiated in March 2006, influenced the rate of hospital admissions for childhood asthma. Methods: Routine hospital administrative data were used to identify all hospital admissions for asthma in Scotland from January 2000 through October 2009 among children younger than 15 years of age. A negative binomial regression model was fitted, with adjustment for age group, sex, quintile of socioeconomic status, urban or rural residence, month, and year. Tests for interactions were also performed. Results: Before the legislation was implemented, admissions for asthma were increasing at a mean rate of 5.2% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 6.6). After implementation of the legislation, there was a mean reduction in the rate of admissions of 18.2% per year relative to the rate on March 26, 2006 (95% CI, 14.7 to 21.8; P<0.001). The reduction was apparent among both preschool and school-age children. There were no significant interactions between hospital admissions for asthma and age group, sex, urban or rural residence, region, or quintile of socioeconomic status. Conclusions: In Scotland, passage of smoke-free legislation in 2006 was associated with a subsequent reduction in the rate of respiratory disease in populations other than those with occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

Induction of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Primary Airway Epithelial Cells from Patients with Asthma by Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						asthma; epithelial-mesenchymal transition; transforming growth factor-beta 1; epithelium	GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; RETICULAR BASEMENT-MEMBRANE; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; EXPRESSION; MOUSE; LUNG; SMAD; TRANSDIFFERENTIATION; TGF-BETA-1	Rationale Airway remodeling in asthma is associated with the accumulation of fibroblasts, the primary cell responsible for synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. The process by which the number of fibroblasts increases in asthma is poorly understood, but epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play a significant role. Objectives: To evaluate whether EMT occurs in primary airway epithelial cells (AECs), the mechanisms involved, and if this process is altered in asthmatic AECs. Methods: AECs were obtained from subjects with asthma (n = 8) and normal subjects without asthma (n = 10). Monolayer and air-liquid interface-AEC (ALI-AEC) cultures were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 (10 ng/ml) for 72 hours and assayed for mesenchymal and epithelial markers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, confocal microscopy, and immunoblot. The involvement of BMP-7, Smad3, and MAPK-mediated signaling were also evaluated. Measurements and Main Results: TGF-beta 1-induced EMT in AEC monolayers derived from subjects with asthma and normal donors. EMT was characterized by changes in cell morphology, increased expression of mesenchymal markers EDA-fibronectin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen-1, and loss of epithelial markers E-cadherin and zonular occludin-1. Inhibition of TGF-beta 1-induced signaling with Smad3-inhibiting siRNA or TGF-beta 1-neutralizing antibodies prevented and reversed EMT, respectively, whereas BMP-7 had no effect. In ALI-AEC cultures derived from normal subjects, EMT was confined to basally situated cells, whereas in asthmatic ALI-AEC cultures EMT was widespread throughout the epithelium. Conclusions: TGF-beta 1 induces EMT in a Smad3-dependent manner in primary AECs. However, in asthmatic-derived ALI-AEC cultures, the number of cells undergoing EMT is greater. These findings support the hypothesis that epithelial repair in asthmatic airways is dysregulated.

However, investigators conducting genome-wide association studies typically test for only the marginal effects of each genetic marker on disease. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient and easily implemented 2-step analysis of genome-wide association study data aimed at identifying genes involved in a gene-environment interaction. The procedure complements screening for marginal genetic effects and thus has the potential to uncover new genetic signals that have not been identified previously.

A change in the genetic predisposition is an unlikely cause of the increase in allergic diseases because genetic changes in a population require several generations. Consequently, this increase may be explained by changes in environmental factors, including indoor and outdoor air pollution. Over the past two decades, there has been increasing interest in studies of air pollution and its effects on human health. Although the role played by outdoor pollutants in allergic sensitization of the airways has yet to be clarified, a body of evidence suggests that urbanization, with its high levels of vehicle emissions, and a westernized lifestyle are linked to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases observed in most industrialized countries, and there is considerable evidence that asthmatic persons are at increased risk of developing asthma exacerbations with exposure to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and inhalable particulate matter. However, it is not easy to evaluate the impact of air pollution on the timing of asthma exacerbations and on the prevalence of asthma in general. As concentrations of airborne allergens and air pollutants are frequently increased contemporaneously, an enhanced IgE-mediated response to aeroallergens and enhanced airway inflammation could account for the increasing frequency of allergic respiratory allergy and bronchial asthma. Pollinosis is frequently used to study the interrelationship between air pollution and respiratory allergy. Climatic factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, thunderstorms, etc) can affect both components (biological and chemical) of this interaction. By attaching to the surface of pollen grains and of plant-derived particles of paucimicronic size, pollutants could modify not only the morphology of these antigen-carrying agents but also their allergenic potential. In addition, by inducing airway inflammation, which increases airway permeability, pollutants overcome the mucosal barrier and could be able to 'prime' allergen-induced responses. There are also observations that a thunderstorm occurring during pollen season can induce severe asthma attacks in pollinosis patients. After rupture by thunderstorm, pollen grains may release part of their cytoplasmic content, including inhalable, allergen-carrying paucimicronic particles.

Yet endotoxin represents only a part of the indoor microbial exposure. Muramic acid, a constituent of peptidoglycan, is present in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in the environment and may therefore serve as an additional marker of microbial exposure. Objective: To study the factors determining the level of indoor exposure to muramic acid/peptidoglycan, as well as its potential association with respiratory health. Methods: In 553 farm and nonfarm school children from Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, mattress dust muramic acid concentrations were determined, and health was assessed by using IgE measurements and questionnaire information. Results: The muramic acid concentration was found to be significantly higher in dust from farm children's mattresses than in dust from nonfarm children's mattresses (157 vs 131 ng/mg). Children with higher mattress dust muramic acid concentrations had a significantly lower prevalence of wheezing (odds ratio of highest vs lowest tertile of muramic acid concentration, 0.3; 95 % CI, 0.1-0.9), regardless of farming status and endotoxin exposure. The association for asthma was similar, and no association was found with atopic sensitization. Conclusion: Next to endotoxin, muramic acid provides us with an independent marker of microbial exposure. Unlike endotoxin, muramic acid was inversely associated with wheezing rather than with atopic sensitization.

Methods: In 226 healthy children, serum surfactant associated proteins A and B (SP-A and SP-B), 16 kDa Clara cell protein (CC 16), and IgE were measured. Lung specific proteins were measured in the serum of 16 children and 13 adults before and after exposure to NCl3, in an indoor chlorinated pool. Relations between pool attendance and asthma prevalence were studied in 1881 children. Asthma was screened with the exercise induced bronchoconstriction test (EIB). Results: Pool attendance was the most consistent predictor of lung epithelium permeability. A positive dose-effect relation was found with cumulated pool attendance and serum SP-A and SP-B. Serum IgE. was unrelated to pool attendance, but correlated positively with lung hyperpermeability as assessed by serum SP-B. Changes in serum levels of lung proteins were reproduced in children and adults attending an indoor pool. Serum SP-A and SP-B were already significantly increased after one hour on the pool side without swimming. Positive EIB and total asthma prevalence were significantly correlated with cumulated pool attendance indices. Conclusions: Regular attendance at chlorinated pools by Young children is associated with an exposure dependent increase in lung epithelium permeability and increase in the risk of developing asthma especially in association with other risk factors. We therefore postulate that the increasing exposure of children to chlorination products in indoor pools might be an important cause of the rising incidence of childhood asthma and allergic diseases in industrialised countries.

We hypothesized that airway physiology would differ between mice subjected to brief or chronic allergen exposure, and that these differences would be associated with characteristic inflammatory markers and indices of airway remodeling. BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin and studied at several time points following brief or chronic allergen challenge protocols. By measuring airway responses to methacholine, we demonstrated increases in maximal inducible bronchoconstriction that persisted for 8 wk following either brief or chronic allergen challenge; we also observed increases in airway reactivity, although it was only in chronically challenged mice that these changes persisted beyond the resolution of allergen-induced inflammation. Using airway morphometry, we further demonstrated that increases in maximal bronchoconstriction were associated with increases in airway contractile tissue in both models, and that chronic, but not brief, allergen challenge resulted in subepithelial fibrosis. Our observations that different aspects of sustained airway dysfunction and remodeling persist beyond the resolution of acute inflammatory events support the concept that remodeling occurs as a consequence of allergic airway inflammation, and that these structural changes contribute independently to the persistence of airway hyperresponsiveness.

One of the most important problems is confounding by other lifestyle factors. Objective The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of any breastfeeding duration on the prevalence of atopic eczema in the first seven years of life taking into account other risk factors. Methods In an observational birth cohort study 1314 infants born in 1990 were followed-up for seven years. At 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months and every year thereafter, parents were interviewed and filled in questionnaires, children were examined and blood was taken for in vitro allergy tests. Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE)-models were used to model risk factors for the prevalence of atopic eczema and for confounder adjustment Results Breastfeeding was carried out for longer if at least one parent had eczema, the mother was older, did not smoke in pregnancy, and the family had a high social status. The prevalence of atopic eczema in the first seven years increased with each year of age (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09 for each year), with each additional month of breastfeeding (1.03; 1.00-1.06 for each additional month), with a history of parental atopic eczema (2.06; 1.38-3.08), and if other atopic signs and symptoms appeared, especially specific sensitization (1.53; 1.25-1.88), and asthma (1.41; 1.07-1.85). Although breastfeeding should be recommended for all infants, it does not prevent eczema in children with a genetic risk. Conclusion Parental eczema is the major risk factor for eczema. But in this study, each month of breastfeeding also increased the risk.

Objective: This study was designed to define the prevalence of mouse sensitivity and its relationship to mouse allergen exposure and disease activity in inner-city children with asthma, Methods: A subset Of 499 subjects from the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study had dust samples adequate for mouse allergen analysis, as well as valid puncture skin test (PST) results, Data were analyzed to relate mouse allergen exposure and other risk factors to mouse sensitization and asthma morbidity, Results: Eighty-nine (18%) of the 499 children had a positive mouse skin test response, Children whose homes had mouse allergen levels above the median (1.60 mug/g) in the kitchen had a significantly higher rate of mouse sensitization (23% vs 11%, P = .007). Atopy was also significantly related to mouse sensitization, with 40% of those with more than 4 positive PST responses having mouse sensitivity compared with 4% of those with no other positive PST responses (P < .0001). When atopy and exposure were considered together, 53% of those with more than 4 positive PST responses and allergen levels above the median had a positive PST response to mouse allergen compared with 22% of those with more than 4 positive PST responses and allergen levels below the median (P < .0001).

Association Between Participation in a Multipayer Medical Home Intervention and Changes in Quality, Utilization, and Costs of Care	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; STRUCTURAL CAPABILITIES; TRANSFORMATION; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; TRIAL; WILL	IMPORTANCE Interventions to transform primary care practices into medical homes are increasingly common, but their effectiveness in improving quality and containing costs is unclear. OBJECTIVE To measure associations between participation in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, one of the earliest and largest multipayer medical home pilots conducted in the United States, and changes in the quality, utilization, and costs of care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thirty-two volunteering primary care practices participated in the pilot (conducted from June 1, 2008, to May 31, 2011). We surveyed pilot practices to compare their structural capabilities at the pilot's beginning and end. Using claims data from 4 participating health plans, we compared changes (in each year, relative to before the intervention) in the quality, utilization, and costs of care delivered to 64 243 patients who were attributed to pilot practices and 55 959 patients attributed to 29 comparison practices (selected for size, specialty, and location similar to pilot practices) using a difference-in-differences design. EXPOSURES Pilot practices received disease registries and technical assistance and could earn bonus payments for achieving patient-centered medical home recognition by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Practice structural capabilities; performance on 11 quality measures for diabetes, asthma, and preventive care; utilization of hospital, emergency department, and ambulatory care; standardized costs of care. RESULTS Pilot practices successfully achieved NCQA recognition and adopted new structural capabilities such as registries to identify patients overdue for chronic disease services. Pilot participation was associated with statistically significantly greater performance improvement, relative to comparison practices, on 1 of 11 investigated quality measures: nephropathy screening in diabetes (adjusted performance of 82.7% vs 71.7% by year 3, P<.001). Pilot participation was not associated with statistically significant changes in utilization or costs of care. Pilot practices accumulated average bonuses of $92 000 per primary care physician during the 3-year intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multipayer medical home pilot, in which participating practices adopted new structural capabilities and received NCQA certification, was associated with limited improvements in quality and was not associated with reductions in utilization of hospital, emergency department, or ambulatory care services or total costs over 3 years. These findings suggest that medical home interventions may need further refinement.

A common feature of this population is the so-called "type 2 immune response," which confers protection against helminths, but also promotes pathologic responses associated with allergic inflammation. However, the mechanisms that initiate and control type 2 responses remain enigmatic. Recent advances have revealed a role for the innate immune system in orchestrating type 2 responses against a bewildering array of stimuli, from nanometer-sized allergens to 20-meter-long helminth parasites. Here, we review these advances and suggest that the human immune system has evolved multiple mechanisms of sensing such stimuli, from recognition of molecular patterns via innate immune receptors to detecting metabolic changes and tissue damage caused by these stimuli.

LUNG-FUNCTION GROWTH; 3 EUROPEAN AREAS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; BIRTH COHORT; CHILDREN; HEALTH; ASTHMA; SCHOOLCHILDREN	Background: Urban air pollution can trigger asthma symptoms in children, but there is conflicting evidence on effects of long-term exposure on lung function, onset of airway disease and allergic sensitization. Methods: The spatial distribution of nitrogen oxides from traffic (traffic-NOx) and inhalable particulate matter from traffic (traffic-PM10) in the study area was assessed with emission databases and dispersion modeling. Estimated levels were used to assign first-year exposure levels for children in a prospective birth cohort (n = 4089), by linking to geocoded home addresses. Parents in 4 Swedish municipalities provided questionnaire data on symptoms and exposures when the children were 2 months and 1, 2, and 4-year-old. At 4 years, 73% of the children underwent clinical examination including peak expiratory flow and specific IgE measurements. Results: Exposure to air pollution from traffic during the first year of life was associated with an excess risk of persistent wheezing (odds ratio [OR] for 44 mu g/m(3) [5th-95th percentile] difference in traffic-NO, = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.09-2.36). Similar results were found for sensitization (measured as specific IgE) to inhalant allergens, especially pollen (OR for traffic-NO, = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.10-2.53), at the age of 4 years. Traffic-related air pollution exposure during the first year of life was also associated with lower lung function at 4 years of age. Results were similar using traffic-NOx and traffic-PM10 as indicators. Conclusions: Exposure to moderate levels of locally emitted air pollution from traffic early in life appears to influence the development of airway disease and sensitization in preschool children.

First, we show that although atopy is associated with atopic dermatitis to some degree, its importance is not likely to be a simple cause-and-effect relationship, especially at a population level. Our epidemiologic data do not exclude a contributory role for IgE-mediated immunologic processes, especially in those with existing and severe disease. Second, evidence is presented that does not support a straightforward inverse relationship between infections and atopic dermatitis risk. A link, if present, is likely to be more complex, depending critically on the timing and type of infectious exposure. Third, recent evidence suggests that the risk of subsequent childhood asthma is not increased in children with early atopic dermatitis who are not also early wheezers, suggesting a comanifestation of phenotypes rather than a progressive atopic march. Collectively, these observations underline the importance of epidemiologic studies conducted at a population level to gain a more balanced understanding of the enigma of atopic dermatitis.

It is now clear that these molecules play a much wider role in immune homeostasis, playing key roles in driving the maturation, homing, and activation of leukocytes. In this review we analyze the roles chemokines play in the development, recruitment, and activation of leukocytes. Because signaling from the receptors drives these processes, signal transduction from chemokine receptors will also be reviewed. Taken together, we highlight the various points at which chemokines contribute to allergic inflammation and at which their targeting might contribute to new therapies for type I hypersensitivity reactions.

On the other hand, later in life, it adversely affects patients with asthma. Endotoxin binding to receptors on macrophages and other cells generates IL-12, which inhibits IgE responses. It also generates cytokines like IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-8, which cause inflammation. These signal transduction pathways resemble those leading to the generation of cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5, which are responsible for the inflammation of IgE-mediated allergic disease. The main difference seems to be that endotoxin recruits neutrophils, but IgE recruits eosinophils, and the details of the tissue injury from these granulocytes differ. Sources of airborne endotoxin include many agricultural dusts, aerosols from contaminated water in many industrial plants, contaminated heating and air-conditioning systems, mist-generating humidifiers, and damp or water-damaged homes. Acute inhalation of high concentrations of endotoxin can cause fever, cough, and dyspnea. Chronic inhalation of lesser amounts causes chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness. Airborne endotoxin adversely affects patients with asthma in 3 ways: (1) by increasing the severity of the airway inflammation; (2) by increasing the susceptibility to rhinovirus-induced colds; and (3) by causing chronic bronchitis and emphysema with development of irreversible airway obstruction after chronic exposure of adults. The most effective management is mitigating exposure. The potential of drug treatments requires further clinical investigation.

Local temperature, precipitation, clouds, atmospheric water vapor. wind speed, and wind direction influence atmospheric chemical processes, and interactions occur between local and global-scale environments. If the climate becomes warmer and more variable, air quality is likely to be affected. However, the specific types of change (i.e., local, regional, or global), the direction of change in a particular location (i.e., positive or negative), and the magnitude of change in air quality that may be attributable to climate change are a matter of speculation, based on extrapolating present understanding to future scenarios. There is already extensive evidence on the health effects of air pollution. Ground-level ozone can exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases and cause short-term reductions in lung function. Exposure to particulate matter can aggravate chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alter host defenses, damage lung tissue, lead to premature death, and possibly contribute to cancer. Health effects of exposures to carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide can include reduced work capacity, aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases, effects on pulmonary function, respiratory illnesses, lung irritation, and alterations in the lung's defense systems. Adaptations to climate change should include ensuring responsiveness of air quality protection programs to changing pollution levels. Research needs include basic atmospheric science work on the association between weather and air pollutants; improving air pollution models and their linkage with climate change scenarios; and closing gaps in the understanding of exposure patterns and health effects.

An Unexpected Role for Uric Acid as an Inducer of T Helper 2 Cell Immunity to Inhaled Antigens and Inflammatory Mediator of Allergic Asthma	IMMUNITY			English	Article							HOUSE-DUST MITE; INDUCED NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION; MONOSODIUM URATE CRYSTALS; HELPER TYPE-2 RESPONSE; CD4(+) T-CELLS; DENDRITIC CELLS; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; NALP3 INFLAMMASOME; XANTHINE-OXIDASE; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY	Although deposition of uric acid (UA) crystals is known as the cause of gout, it is unclear whether UA plays a role in other inflammatory diseases. We here have shown that UA is released in the airways of allergen-challenged asthmatic patients and mice, where it was necessary for mounting T helper 2 (Th2) cell immunity, airway eosinophilia, and bronchial hyperreactivity to inhaled harmless proteins and clinically relevant house dust mite allergen. Conversely, administration of UA crystals together with protein antigen was sufficient to promote Th2 cell immunity and features of asthma. The adjuvant effects of UA did not require the inflammasome (NIrp3, Pycard) or the interleukin-1 (Myd88, IL-1r) axis. UA crystals promoted Th2 cell immunity by activating dendritic cells through spleen tyrosine kinase and PI3-kinase delta signaling. These findings provide further molecular insight into Th2 cell development and identify UA as an essential initiator and amplifier of allergic inflammation.	[Kool, Mirjam; Willart, Monique A.

Ageing is associated with unique issues that modify expression, recognition, and treatment of the disease. In particular, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) both overlap and converge in older people. This concurrence, together with absence of precise diagnostic methods, makes diagnosis complex. A multidimensional assessment that addresses airway problems, comorbidities, risk factors, and management skills will draw attention to key needs for intervention. Increased attention to the complications of asthma and obstructive airway disease in older people is needed, specifically to develop effective systems of care, appropriate clinical practice guidelines, and a research agenda that delivers improved health outcomes.

soy allergy; breast-feeding; skin prick test; oral challenge	KOALA BIRTH COHORT; FOOD CHALLENGES; PEANUT ALLERGY; INFANTS; IMMEDIATE; CHILDREN; AGE; HYPERSENSITIVITY; CONSUMPTION; CHILDHOOD	Background: The diversity in the perceived prevalence, recovery, and risk factors for cow's milk allergy (CMA) necessitated a large-scale, population-based prospective study. Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence, cross-reactivity with soy allergy, and risk factors for the development of CMA. Methods: In a prospective study the feeding history of 13,019 infants was obtained by means of telephone interview (95.8%) or questionnaire (4.2%). Infants with probable adverse reactions to milk were examined, skin prick tested, and challenged orally. Results: Ninety-eight percent of the cohort participated in the study. The cumulative incidence for IgE-mediated CMA was 0.5% (66/13,019 patients). The mean age of cow's milk protein (CMP) introduction was significantly different (P<.001) between the healthy infants (61.6 +/- 92.5 days) and those with IgE-mediated CMA (116.1 +/- 64.9 days). Only 0.05% of the infants who were started on regular CMP formula within the first 14 days versus 1.75% who were started on formula between the ages of 105 and 194 days had IgE-mediated CMA (P<.001). The odds ratio was 19.3 (95% CI, 6.0-62.1) for development of IgE-mediated CMA among infants with exposure to CMP at the age of 15 days or more (P<.001). Sixty-four patients with IgE-mediated CMA tolerated soy, and none had a proved allergy to soy. Conclusions: IgE-mediated CMA is much less common than generally reported. Early exposure to CMP as a supplement to breast-feeding might promote tolerance. Finally, soy is a reasonable feeding alternative in patients with IgE-mediated CMA.

SPDEF is required for mouse pulmonary goblet cell differentiation and regulates a network of genes associated with mucus production	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; HUMAN AIRWAY; LUNG MORPHOGENESIS; MUCIN BIOSYNTHESIS; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; ASTHMA; GROWTH; IL-13	Various acute and chronic inflammatory stimuli increase the number and activity of pulmonary mucus-producing goblet cells, and goblet cell hyperplasia and excess mucus production are central to the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary diseases. However, little is known about the transcriptional programs that regulate goblet cell differentiation. Here, we show that SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor (SPDEF) controls a transcriptional program critical for pulmonary goblet cell differentiation in mice. Initial cell-lineage-tracing analysis identified nonciliated secretory epithelial cells, known as Clara cells, as the progenitors of goblet cells induced by pulmonary allergen exposure in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo expression of SPDEF in Clara cells caused rapid and reversible goblet cell differentiation in the absence of cell proliferation. This was associated with enhanced expression of genes regulating goblet cell differentiation and protein glycosylation, including forkhead box A3 (Foxa3), anterior gradient 2 (Agr2), and glucosaminyl. (N-acetyl) transferase 3, mucin type (Gcnt3). Consistent with these findings, levels of SPDEF and FOXA3 were increased in mouse goblet cells after sensitization with pulmonary allergen, and the proteins were colocalized in goblet cells lining the airways of patients with chronic lung diseases. Deletion of the mouse Spdef gene resulted in the absence of goblet cells in tracheal/laryngeal submucosal glands and in the conducting airway epithelium after pulmonary allergen exposure in vivo. These data show that SPDEF plays a critical role in regulating a transcriptional network mediating the goblet cell differentiation and mucus hyperproduction associated with chronic pulmonary disorders.

Asthma and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms 5 to 6 Years Following Exposure to the World Trade Center Terrorist Attack	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							NEW-YORK-CITY; CENTER HEALTH REGISTRY; DISASTER VICTIMS SPEAK; 11 SEPTEMBER 2001; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; RECOVERY WORKERS; PTSD CHECKLIST; RISK-FACTORS; CENTER SITE	Context The World Trade Center Health Registry provides a unique opportunity to examine long-term health effects of a large-scale disaster. Objective To examine risk factors for new asthma diagnoses and event-related post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms among exposed adults 5 to 6 years following exposure to the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center (WTC) terrorist attack. Design, Setting, and Participants Longitudinal cohort study with wave 1 (W1) enrollment of 71 437 adults in 2003-2004, including rescue/recovery worker, lower Manhattan resident, lower Manhattan office worker, and passersby eligibility groups; 46 322 adults (68%) completed the wave 2 (W2) survey in 2006-2007. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported diagnosed asthma following September 11; event-related current PTS symptoms indicative of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), assessed using the PTSD Checklist (cutoff score >= 44). Results Of W2 participants with no stated asthma history, 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9%-10.5%) reported new asthma diagnoses postevent. Intense dust cloud exposure on September 11 was a major contributor to new asthma diagnoses for all eligibility groups: for example, 19.1% vs 9.6% in those without exposure among rescue/recovery workers (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5 [ 95% CI, 1.4-1.7]). Asthma risk was highest among rescue/recovery workers on the WTC pile on September 11 (20.5% [ 95% CI, 19.0%-22.0%]). Persistent risks included working longer at the WTC site, not evacuating homes, and experiencing a heavy layer of dust in home or office. Of participants with no PTSD history, 23.8% ( 95% CI, 23.4%-24.2%) reported PTS symptoms at either W1(14.3%) or W2 (19.1%). Nearly 10% ( 9.6% [ 95% CI, 9.3%-9.8%]) had PTS symptoms at both surveys, 4.7% ( 95% CI, 4.5%-4.9%) had PTS symptoms at W1 only, and 9.5% ( 95% CI, 9.3%-9.8%) had PTS symptoms at W2 only. At W2, passersby had the highest rate of PTS symptoms (23.2% [ 95% CI, 21.4%-25.0%]). Event-related loss of spouse or job was associated with PTS symptoms at W2. Conclusion Acute and prolonged exposures were both associated with a large burden of asthma and PTS symptoms 5 to 6 years after the September 11 WTC attack.

Respiratory health and individual estimated exposure to traffic-related air pollutants in a cohort of young children	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							PARTICULATE MATTER; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; BIRTH COHORT; POLLUTION; ASTHMA; SYMPTOMS; ASSOCIATION; GIS	Objectives: To estimate long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants on an individual basis and to assess adverse health effects using a combination of air pollution measurement data, data from geographical information systems (GIS) and questionnaire data. Methods: 40 measurement sites in the city of Munich, Germany were selected at which to collect particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mm (PM2.5) and to measure PM2.5 absorbance and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). A pool of GIS variables (information about street length, household and population density and land use) was collected for the Munich metropolitan area and was used in multiple linear regression models to predict traffic-related air pollutants. These models were also applied to the birth addresses of two birth cohorts (German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (GINI) and Influence of Life-style factors on the development of the Immune System and Allergies in East and West Germany (LISA)) in the Munich metropolitan area. Associations between air pollution concentrations at birth address and 1-year and 2-year incidences of respiratory symptoms were analysed. Results: The following means for the estimated exposures to PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance and NO2 were obtained: 12.8 mu g/m(3), 1.7 x 10(-5) m(-1) and 35.3 mu g/m(3), respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for wheezing, cough without infection, dry cough at night, bronchial asthma, bronchitis and respiratory infections indicated positive associations with traffic-related air pollutants. After controlling for individual confounders, significant associations were found between the pollutant PM2.5 and sneezing, runny/stuffed nose during the first year of life (OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.34) Similar effects were observed for the second year of life. These findings are similar to those from our previous analysis that were restricted to a subcohort in Munich city. The extended study also showed significant effects for sneezing, running/stuffed nose. Additionally, significant associations were found between NO2 and dry cough at night (or bronchitis) during the first year of life. The variable "living close to major roads'' (< 50 m), which was not analysed for the previous inner city cohort with birth addresses in the city of Munich, turned out to increase the risk of wheezing and asthmatic/spastic/obstructive bronchitis. Conclusions: Effects on asthma and hay fever are subject to confirmation at older ages, when these outcomes can be more validly assessed.

Therefore, to elicit allergic sensitization, researchers have been compelled to devise alternative strategies, such as the systemic delivery of OVA in the context of powerful adjuvants, which are alien to the way humans are exposed and sensitized to allergens. The objectives of these studies were to investigate immune-inflammatory responses to intranasal delivery of a purified house dust mite (HDM) extract and to evaluate the role of GM-CSF in this process. HDM was delivered to BALB/c mice daily for 10 days. After the last exposure, mice were killed, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, and samples were obtained. Expression/production of Th2-associated molecules in the lymph nodes, lung, and spleen were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA, respectively. Using this exposure protocol, exposure to HDM alone generated Th2 sensitization based on the expression/production of Th2 effector molecules and airway eosinophilic inflammation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expansion and activation of APCs in the lung and an influx of activated Th2 effector cells. Moreover, this inflammation was accompanied by airways hyper-responsiveness and a robust memory-driven immune response. Finally, administration of anti-GM-CSF-neutralizing Abs markedly reduced immune-inflammatory responses in both lung and spleen. Thus, intranasal delivery of HDM results in Th2 sensitization and airway eosinophilic inflammation that appear to be mediated, at least in part, by endogenous GM-CSF production.

Study design: Eighty-three children with clinical peanut hypersensitivity diagnosed before their fourth birthdays were contacted yearly to track adverse peanut reactions. Serum peanut-specific IgE levels were determined in 51 of 83 subjects. Results: Fifty-eight percent (31/53) of subjects followed up for 5 years experienced adverse reactions from accidental peanut exposure, Regardless of the nature of their initial reaction, the majority with subsequent reactions (52%, 31/60) experienced potentially life-threatening symptoms. The group with isolated skin symptoms (11/51, 22%) had lower serum peanut-specific IgE levels than the group with respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (40/51, 78%) (median: 1.25 kU(A)/L vs 11.65 kU(A)/L, P = .004, Wilcoxon rank sums test). Despite this, there was no threshold level below which only skin symptoms appeared to occur. Four selected subjects had negative double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge responses to peanuts during follow-up. Conclusions: The majority of children with clinical peanut hypersensitivity followed up for 5 years will have adverse reactions from accidental peanut exposure. Symptoms experienced during subsequent adverse peanut reactions may not be consistent with symptoms reported during initial reactions. Therefore proper education regarding peanut avoidance land treatment of adverse reactions is necessary in all cases of clinical peanut hypersensitivity. Young children who are allergic to peanuts can lose clinical hypersensitivity.

In this study the relation between these agents and peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability was investigated in 148 children 7 to 11 yr of age of whom 50% had self- or parent-reported chronic respiratory symptoms. All children self-monitored twice daily their PEF for a period of 16 wk. Dust samples were collected from mattresses and from living room and bedroom floors, and endotoxin and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan were measured in dust extracts. The relations with mean daily PEF variability (Ampl%mean) were investigated by linear regression analysis, adjusting for dust mite allergen levels, presence of pets, and type of floor cover. In unadjusted analyses the levels of both endotoxin and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan per square meter of living room floor were significantly associated with PEF-variability (but not when expressed per gram of sampled dust), particularly in atopic children with asthma symptoms. Adjusted analyses showed the same association for (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan but not for endotoxin. Although no associations were found with microbial agent levels in bedroom floor or mattress dust, high levels of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in living room floor dust apparently increase PEF variability in asthmatic children.

Tiotropium improves lung function in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma: A randomized controlled trial	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Asthma; severe uncontrolled asthma; randomized controlled trial; anticholinergics; tiotropium	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; COPD PATIENTS; BROMIDE; ADULTS; EFFICACY	Background: Some patients with severe asthma remain symptomatic and obstructed despite maximal recommended treatment. Tiotropium, a long-acting inhaled anticholinergic agent, might be an effective bronchodilator in such patients. Objective: We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of tiotropium (5 and 10 mu g daily) administered through the Respimat inhaler with placebo as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire score, >= 1.5; postbronchodilator FEV(1), <= 80% of predicted value) despite maintenance treatment with at least a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta(2)-agonist. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with three 8-week treatment periods. The primary end point was peak FEV(1) at the end of each treatment period. Results: Of 107 randomized patients (54% female patients; mean, 55 years of age; postbronchodilator FEV(1), 65% of predicted value), 100 completed all periods. Peak FEV(1) was significantly higher with 5 mu g (difference, 139 mL; 95% CI, 96181 mL) and 10 mu g (difference, 170 mL; 95% CI, 128-213 mL) of tiotropium than with placebo (both P < .0001). There was no significant difference between the active doses. Trough FEV(1) at the end of the dosing interval was higher with tiotropium (5 mg: 86 mL [95% CI, 41-132 mL]; 10 mg: 113 mL [95% CI, 67-159 mL]; both P < .0004). Daily home peak expiratory flow measurements were higher with both tiotropium doses. There were no significant differences in asthma-related health status or symptoms. Adverse events were balanced across groups except for dry mouth, which was more common on 10 mu g of tiotropium. Conclusion: The addition of once-daily tiotropium to asthma treatment, including a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta(2)-agonist, significantly improves lung function over 24 hours in patients with inadequately controlled, severe, persistent asthma.

Exhaled Breath Profiling Enables Discrimination of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Asthma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						biomarkers; diagnosis; electronic nose; exhaled breath; volatile organic compounds	ELECTRONIC NOSE; LUNG-CANCER; SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION; GLOBAL STRATEGY; COPD; AIR; SIMILARITIES; BIOMARKERS; PROTEOMICS; MECHANISMS	Rationale Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma can exhibit overlapping clinical features. Exhaled air contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may qualify as noninvasive biomarkers. VOC profiles can be assessed using integrative analysis by electronic nose, resulting in exhaled molecular fingerprints (breathprints). Objectives: We hypothesized that breathprints by electronic nose can discriminate patients with COPD and asthma. Methods: Ninety subjects participated in a cross-sectional study: 30 patients with COPD (age, 61.6+/-9.3 years; FEV1, 1.72+/-0.69 L), 20 patients with asthma (age, 35.4+/-15.1 years; FEV1, 3.32+/-0.86 L), 20 nonsmoking control subjects (age, 56.7+/-9.3 years; FEV1, 3.44+/-0.76 L), and 20 smoking control subjects (age, 56.1+/-5.9 years; FEV1, 3.58+/-0.78). After 5 minutes of tidal breathing through an inspiratory VOC filter, an expiratory vital capacity was collected in a Tedlar bag and sampled by electronic nose. Breathprints were analyzed by discriminant analysis on principal component reduction resulting in cross-validated accuracy values (accuracy). Repeatability and reproducibility were assessed by measuring samples in duplicate by two devices. Measurements and Main Results: Breathprints from patients with asthma were separated from patients with COPD (accuracy 96%; P < 0.001), from nonsmoking control subjects (accuracy, 95%; P < 0.001), and from smoking control subjects (accuracy, 92.5%; P < 0.001). Exhaled breath profiles of patients with COPD partially overlapped with those of asymptomatic smokers (accuracy, 66%; P = 0.006). Measurements were repeatable and reproducible. Conclusions: Molecular profiling of exhaled air can distinguish patients with COPD and asthma and control subjects. Our data demonstrate a potential of electronic noses in the differential diagnosis of obstructive airway diseases and in the risk assessment in asymptomatic smokers.

The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is for use by both adult physicians and paediatricians practicing in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking, consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification of rhinitis, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations and management including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy. There are also special sections for children, co-morbid associations and pregnancy. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.	[Mirakian, R.; Clark, A.

Early exposure to solid foods in infancy has been associated with the development of allergy. The aim of this study was to examine the association between cereal-grain exposures (wheat, barley, rye, oats) in the infant diet and development of wheat allergy. METHODS. A total of 1612 children were enrolled at birth and followed to the mean age of 4.7 years. Questionnaire data and dietary exposures were obtained at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 months and annually thereafter. The main outcome measure was parent report of wheat allergy. Children with celiac disease autoimmunity detected by tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies were excluded. Wheat-specific immunoglobulin E levels on children reported to have wheat allergy were obtained. RESULTS. Sixteen children (1%) reported wheat allergy. Children who were first exposed to cereals after 6 months of age had an increased risk of wheat allergy compared with children first exposed to cereals before 6 months of age ( after controlling for confounders including a family history of allergic disorders and history of food allergy before 6 months of age). All 4 children with detectable wheat-specific immunoglobulin E were first exposed to cereal grains after 6 months. A first-degree relative with asthma, eczema, or hives was also independently associated with an increased risk of wheat-allergy development. CONCLUSIONS. Delaying initial exposure to cereal grains until after 6 months may increase the risk of developing wheat allergy. These results do not support delaying introduction of cereal grains for the protection of food allergy.

We examined the relationships among maternal smoking in pregnancy, fetal development, and the risk of asthma in childhood. Methods. We conducted a population-based cohort study, where all 58841 singleton births were followed for 7 years using nationwide registries. Results. Maternal smoking increased the risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.13, 1.62 for high exposure). Low birthweight and preterm delivery increased the risk of asthma at the age of 7, whereas being small for gestational age did not. Conclusions. Maternal smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of asthma during the first 7 years of life, and only a small fraction of the effect seems to be mediated through fetal growth.

European time-series analyses have suggested that gaseous air pollutants are important determinants of acute hospitalization for respiratory conditions, at least as important as particulate mass. The association between daily mean levels of suspended particles and gaseous pollutants (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone) was examined. The daily emergency hospital admissions for respiratory conditions in the metropolitan area of Rome during 1995 - 1997,were also recorded. Daily counts of hospital admissions for total respiratory conditions (43 admissions .day(-1)), acute respiratory infections including pneumonia (18.day(-1)), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13.day(-1)), and asthma (4.5.day(-1)) among residents of all ages and among children (0-14 yrs) were analysed, The generalized additive models included spline smooth functions of the day of study, mean temperature, mean humidity, influenza epidemics, and indicator variables for day of the week and holidays, Total respiratory admissions were significantly associated with same-da, level of NO2 (2.5%, increase per interquartile range (IQR) change, 22.3 mug.m(-3)) and CO (2.8% increase per IQR, 1.5 mg.m(-3)). No effect was found for particulate matter and SO2, whereas O-3 was associated with admissions only among children (lag 1, 5.5%, increase per IQR, 23.9 mug.m(3)). The effect of NO2 was stronger on acute respirator!, infections (lag 0, 4.0% increase) and on asthma among children (lag 1, 10.7% increase). The admissions for all ages for asthma and CORD were associated only with same-day level of CO (5.5% and 4.3% increase, respectively). Multipollutant models confirmed the role of CO on all respiratory admissions, including asthma and COPD, and that of NO2 on acute respiratory infections, Among children, O-3 remained a strong indicator of acute respiratory infections, Carbon monoxide and photochetnical pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, ozone) appear to he determinants of acute respiratory conditions in Rome, Since carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are good indicators of combustion products from traffic related sources, the detected effect may be due to unmeasured fine and ultrafine particles.

This study examines the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in asthma patients without reflux symptoms. This prospective cohort study evaluated 26 patients with stable asthma without reflux symptoms using esophageal manometry and 24-h esophageal pH testing. Gastroesophageal reflux was considered present if esophageal acid contact times were abnormal. Demographic variables were analyzed to determine if they predicted the presence of gastroesophageal reflux, Asthma patients with asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux were compared with 30 age-matched asthma patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. The prevalence of abnormal 24-h esophageal pH tests in asthma patients without reflux symptoms was 62% (16 of 26), Demographic variables did not predict abnormal 24-h esophageal pH tests in asthma patients with asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. Asthma patients with asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux had higher amounts of proximal esophageal acid exposure (p < 0.05) compared with asthma patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. Because demographic variables do not predict abnormal 24-h esophageal pH tests in asthma patients without reflux symptoms, 24-h esophageal pH testing is required. This study suggests that gastroesophageal reflux is present in asthma patients, even in the absence of esophageal symptoms.

The mechanisms of action of AIT include the induction of very early desensitization of mast cells and basophils; generation of regulatory T and regulatory B (Breg) cell responses; regulation of IgE and IgG(4); decreases in numbers and activity of eosinophils and mast cells in mucosal allergic tissues; and decreases in the activity of basophils in circulation. Skewing of allergen-specific effector T and effector B cells to a regulatory phenotype appears as a key event in the course of AIT and normal immune response to allergens. Recently, inducible IL-10-secreting Breg cells were also demonstrated to contribute to allergen tolerance through suppression of effector T cells and selective induction of IgG4 isotype antibodies. Allergen-specific regulatory T and Breg cells orchestrate a general immunoregulatory activity, which can be summarized as suppression of cytokines from inflammatory dendritic cells; suppression of effector T(H)1, T(H)2, and T(H)17 cells; suppression of allergen-specific IgE and induction of IgG(4); and suppression of migration of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and effector T cells to tissues. A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of AIT is not only important in designing the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases but might also find applications in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, chronic infection, and cancer.

Pulmonary innate lymphoid cells are major producers of IL-5 and IL-13 in murine models of allergic asthma	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Asthma; Cytokines; House dust mite; Innate immunity; Innate lymphoid cells	ROR-GAMMA-T; AIRWAY HYPERREACTIVITY; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; IN-VIVO; DENDRITIC CELLS; TYPE-2 IMMUNITY; NKP46(+) CELLS; LUNG; INFLAMMATION; CYTOKINE	Allergic asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity and is thought to be mediated by an adaptive T helper-2 (Th2) cell-type immune response. Here, we demonstrate that type 2 pulmonary innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) significantly contribute to production of the key cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in experimental asthma. In naive mice, lineage-marker negative ILC2s expressing IL-7Ra, CD25, Sca-1, and T1/ST2(IL-33R) were present in lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLNs), but not in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Upon intranasal administration of IL-25 or IL-33, an asthma phenotype was induced, whereby ILC2s accumulated in lungs, MedLNs, and BAL fluid. After IL-25 and IL-33 administration, ILC2s constituted similar to 50 and similar to 80% of IL-5+/IL-13+ cells in lung and BAL, respectively. Also in house dust mite-induced or ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma, the ILC2 population in lung and BAL fluid increased significantly in size and ILC2s were a major source of IL-5 or IL-13. Particularly in OVA-induced asthma, the contribution of ILC2s to the total population of intracellular IL-5+ and IL-13+ cells in the lung was in the same range as found for Th2 cells. We conclude that both ILC2s and Th2 cells produce large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 that contribute to allergic airway inflammation.	[Wolterink, Roel G. J.

The relevance of tick bites to the production of IgE antibodies to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Ticks; anaphylaxis; oligosaccharide; alpha-gal; IgE antibody to CCD	AMBLYOMMA-AMERICANUM ACARI; UNITED-STATES; COLORECTAL-CANCER; INDOOR ALLERGEN; ACUTE ASTHMA; CETUXIMAB; ANAPHYLAXIS; HUMANS; RISK; SENSITIZATION	Background: In 2009, we reported a novel form of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat that is related to serum IgE antibodies to the oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). Most of these patients had tolerated meat for many years previously. The implication is that some exposure in adult life had stimulated the production of these IgE antibodies. Objectives: We sought to investigate possible causes of this IgE antibody response, focusing on evidence related to tick bites, which are common in the region where these reactions occur. Methods: Serum assays were carried out with biotinylated proteins and extracts bound to a streptavidin ImmunoCAP. Results: Prospective studies on IgE antibodies in 3 subjects after tick bites showed an increase in levels of IgE to alpha-gal of 20fold or greater. Other evidence included (1) a strong correlation between histories of tick bites and levels of IgE to alpha-gal (chi(2) = 26.8, P < .001), (2) evidence that these IgE antibodies are common in areas where the tick Amblyomma americanum is common, and (3) a significant correlation between IgE antibodies to alpha-gal and IgE antibodies to proteins derived from A americanum (r(s) = 0.75, P < .001). Conclusion: The results presented here provide evidence that tick bites are a cause, possibly the only cause, of IgE specific for alpha-gal in this area of the United States. Both the number of subjects becoming sensitized and the titer of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal are striking. Here we report the first example of a response to an ectoparasite giving rise to an important form of food allergy. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:1286-93.)

BOLD Collaborative Res Grp	COPD in Never Smokers Results From the Population-Based Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Study	CHEST			English	Article							NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY; ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; 3RD NATIONAL-HEALTH; PULMONARY-DISEASE; GRAIN DUST; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; PASSIVE SMOKING; BIOMASS SMOKE; US POPULATION	Background: Never smokers comprise a substantial proportion of patients with COPD. Their characteristics and possible risk factors in this population are not yet well defined. Methods: We analyzed data from 14 countries that participated in the international, population-based Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study. Participants were aged >= 40 years and completed postbronchodilator spirometry testing plus questionnaires about respiratory symptoms, health status, and exposure to COPD risk factors. A diagnosis of COPD was based on the postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio, according to current GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines. In addition to this, the lower limit of normal (LLN) was evaluated as an alternative threshold for the FEV1/FVC ratio. Results: Among 4,291 never smokers, 6.6% met criteria for mild (GOLD stage I) COPD, and 5.6% met criteria for moderate to very severe (GOLD stage II+) COPD. Although never smokers were less likely to have COPD and had less severe COPD than ever smokers, never smokers nonetheless comprised 23.3% (240/1,031) of those classified with GOLD stage II+ COPD. This proportion was similar, 20.5% (171/832), even when the LLN was used as a threshold for the FEV1/FVC ratio. Predictors of COPD in never smokers include age, education, occupational exposure, childhood respiratory diseases, and BMI alterations. Conclusion: This multicenter international study confirms previous evidence that never smokers comprise a substantial proportion of individuals with COPD. Our data suggest that, in addition to increased age, a prior diagnosis of asthma and, among women, lower education levels are associated with an increased risk for COPD among never smokers.

Through interaction with VDR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 mediates numerous biological activities, such as regulation of helper T-cell development and subsequent cytokine secretion profiles. Variants of the VDR have been found to be associated with immune-mediated diseases that are characterized by an imbalance in helper T-cell development, such as Crohn's disease and tuberculosis. The VDR, hence, is a good candidate to be investigated for association with asthma, which is characterized by enhanced helper T-cell type 2 activity. Here, we examined VDR genetic variants in an asthma family-based cohort from Quebec. We report six variants to be strongly associated with asthma and four with atopy (0.0005 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). Analysis of the linkage disequilibrium pattern and haplotypes also revealed significant association with both phenotypes (0.0004 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.01). The findings have been replicated by another research team in a second but not in a third cohort. These results identify VDR variants as genetic risk factors for asthma/atopy and implicate a non-human leukocyte antigen immunoregulatory molecule in the pathogenesis of asthma and atopy.

Methods: We prospectively studied 58 obese women with a body mass index of > 30 kg/m(2), 24 of whom had asthma, who were enrolled in an intensive 6-month weight loss program to determine whether loss of body mass would be correlated with improvements in bronchial reactivity, lung function, and disease-specific health status. Results: Patients lost air average of 20 kg over the 6-month period. For every 10% relative loss of weight, the FVC improved by 92 mL (p = 0.05) and the FEV1 improved by 73 mL (p = 0.04), however, bronchial reactivity did not significantly change with weight loss (p = 0.23). Patients who lost > 13% of their pretreatment weight experienced improvements in FEV1 (p = 0.01), FVC (p = 0.02), and total lung capacity (p = 0.05) compared to patients in the lowest quartile who failed to lose significant amounts of weight. Neither group experienced any significant change in methacholine responsiveness (p = 0.57). Patients who completed the 6-month weight loss program experienced improvements in respiratory health status, irrespective of weight loss. Conclusion: We concluded that weight loss can improve lung function in obese women, however, the improvements appear to be independent of changes in airway reactivity.

Setting: Emergency department at a university hospital. Patients: Forty-three patients presenting with exacerbation of asthma or COPD. Intervention: The patients received emergency treatment and were followed up for 4 weeks. Measurement: Spirometry, blood sampling, pulse oximetry, breathing rate, pulse rate, and dyspnea score was measured before and during emergency treatment. The psychological status was assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale questionnaire at the end of the follow-up period. Results: Anxiety and/or depression was found in 17 patients (40%). Of these patients, nine patients (53%) were admitted to hospital or had a relapse within 1 month, compared with five patients (19%) in the group without anxiety and/or depression (p < 0.05). Among patients who relapsed within 1 month (n = 14), the HAD total score was 12.4 +/- 5.9 compared with 8.6 +/- 5.1 (mean +/- SD) among the patients without a relapse (p < 0.05). After making adjustments for age, gender, atopic status, treatment, and pack-years, the significant association between treatment failure and anxiety and/or depression still remained. Conclusion: Our study indicates that anxiety and depression are related to the outcome of emergency treatment in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease.

Because Der p extracts also have direct effects on epithelial cells, we hypothesized that allergen augments the effects of Th2 cytokines by promoting mediator release from the bronchial epithelium in allergic asthma. To test our hypothesis, primary bronchial epithelial cultures were grown from bronchial brushings of normal and atopic asthmatic subjects. RT-PCR showed that each culture expressed IL-4Ralpha, common gamma-chain, and IL-13Ralpha(1), as well as IL-13Ralpha(2), which negatively regulates IL-13 signaling; FACS analysis confirmed IL-13Ralpha(2) protein expression. Exposure of epithelial cultures to either Der p extracts, TNF-alpha, IL-4, or IL-13 enhanced GM-CSF and IL-8 release, and this was partially suppressible by corticosteroids. Simultaneous exposure of the epithelial cultures to IL-4 or IL-13 together with Der p resulted in a further increase in cytokine release, which was at least additive. Release of TGF-alpha was also increased by TNF-a and combinations of IL-4, IL-13, and Der p; however, this stimulation was only significant in the asthma-derived cultures. These data suggest that, in an allergic environment, Th2 cytokines and allergen have the potential to sustain airway inflammation through a cooperative effect on cytokine release by the bronchial epithelium. Our novel finding that IL-4, IL-13, and allergen enhance release of TGF-a, a ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor that stimulates fibroblast proliferation and goblet cell differentiation, provides a potential link between allergen exposure, Th2 cytokines, and airway remodelling in asthma.

Development of new antiinflammatory strategies for such diseases would be aided by an understanding of mechanisms underlying differential steroid responsiveness. Two protein isoforms of the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) exist, GR alpha and GR beta, which arise from alternative splicing of the GR pre-mRNA primary transcripts. GR beta does not bind glucocorticoids and is an inhibitor of GR alpha activity. Relative amounts of these two GRs can therefore determine the level of glucocorticoid sensitivity. In this study, human neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were studied to determine the relative amounts of each GR isoform. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) using immunofluorescence analysis for GR alpha was 475 +/- 62 and 985 +/- 107 for PBMCs and neutrophils, respectively. For GR beta, the MFI was 350 +/- 60 and 1,389 +/- 143 for PBMCs and neutrophils, respectively (P < 0.05). After interleukin (IL)-8 stimulation of neutrophils, there was a statistically significant increase in intensity of GR<beta> staining to 2,497 +/- 140 (P < 0.05). No change in GR<alpha> expression was observed. This inversion of the GR alpha /GR beta ratio in human neutrophils compared with PBMCs was confirmed by quantitative Western analysis. Increased GR beta mRNA expression in neutrophils at baseline, and after IL-8 exposure, was observed using RNA dot blot analysis. Increased levels of GR alpha /GR beta heterodimers were found in neutrophils as compared with PBMCs using coimmunoprecipitation/Western analysis. Transfection of mouse neutrophils, which do not contain GR beta, resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of cell death when treated with dexamethasone. We conclude that high constitutive expression of GR beta by human neutrophils may provide a mechanism by which these cells escape glucocorticoid-induced cell death. Moreover, upregulation of this GR by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 further enhances their survival in the presence of glucocorticoids during inflammation.

The system uses abbreviated Linnean genus and species names and an Arabic number to indicate the chronology of allergen purification. Most major allergens from mites, animal dander, pollens, insects, and foods have been cloned, and more than 40 three-dimensional allergen structures are in the Protein Database. Allergens are derived from proteins with a variety of biologic functions, including proteases, ligand-binding proteins, structural proteins, pathogenesis-related proteins, lipid transfer proteins, profilins, and calcium-binding proteins. Biologic function, such as the proteolytic enzyme allergens of dust mites, might directly influence the development of IgE responses and might initiate inflammatory responses in the lung that are associated with asthma. Intrinsic structural or biologic properties might also influence the extent to which allergens persist in indoor and outdoor environments or retain their allergenicity in the digestive tract. Analyses of the protein family database suggest that the universe of allergens comprises more than 120 distinct protein families. Structural biology and proteomics define recombinant allergen targets for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and identify motifs, patterns, and structures of immunologic significance.

Many of the acute insults of the past have receded due to centralized health care and regulatory action. However, chronic ailments including asthma and allergies, animal-transmitted diseases, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and depression are on the rise. These diverse illnesses join with forest fragmentation, stream degradation, wetlands destruction, and the concomitant loss of native species to suggest detrimental contributions from the built environment. This paper surveys the state of the science on the impacts of urban design on human health and well-being. Drawing primarily on recent peer-reviewed literature in a broad array of health, planning, and environmental fields, it outlines the influence of design at three spatial scales on aspects of physical and mental health, and social and cultural vibrancy. Selected ecological effects are also discussed to illustrate shared associations with urbanization. While causal chains are generally complex and not always completely understood, sufficient evidence exists to reveal urban design as a powerful tool for improving human condition. Solutions are discussed at the personal and professional level, emphasizing cross-disciplinary collaboration in urban planning and design, and the participation of residents in shaping their living environment. At the parcel scale, greenery and access to it visually and physically are the principal keys to health. These elements must be incorporated into relatively high-density neighborhood designs that include public buildings, open space, mixed land use, and pedestrian walkways to increase physical exercise and enhance civic life. Finally, neighborhoods must be embedded in existing urban infrastructure to provide larger cultural and business opportunities and reduce reliance on the automobile. Further research is recommended to strengthen the associations between design and health. Increased communication on this subject is also necessary between design and health practitioners and their clients and colleagues. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

There are few published data on the impact of change in microbial exposure during pregnancy on the child's risk of developing allergic disease. Using a birth cohort of 24,690 children, derived from the West Midlands General Practice Research Database, we investigated a number of perinatal exposures on the incidence of asthma, eczema, and hay fever. Our findings suggest that exposure to antibiotics in utero is associated with an increased risk of asthma in a dose-related manner (more than two courses of antibiotics compared wit ne adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-1.87), and similar associations are present for eczema (adjust HR 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29) and hay fever (adjusted HR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.22-2.01). Exposure to a range of infections in utero was also associated with a small increased risk of developing allergic disease. Strong protective effects of older siblings on the incidence of allergy are present within this cohort, but previous pregnancies that did not result in a live birth were not protective. Our findings suggest that exposure to antibiotics and to infections in utero is a potentially important risk factor in the development of allergic disease.

Although EAE is classically a prototypicT helper I (THI) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by T(H)2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide.

A Nationwide Survey of Patient Centered Medical Home Demonstration Projects	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						primary care; physician payment; health reform	CHRONIC CARE MODEL; COMMUNITY-HEALTH CENTERS; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; INTERNAL-MEDICINE; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; ASTHMA	The patient centered medical home has received considerable attention as a potential way to improve primary care quality and limit cost growth. Little information exists that systematically compares PCMH pilot projects across the country. Cross-sectional key-informant interviews. Leaders from existing PCMH demonstration projects with external payment reform. We used a semi-structured interview tool with the following domains: project history, organization and participants, practice requirements and selection process, medical home recognition, payment structure, practice transformation, and evaluation design. A total of 26 demonstrations in 18 states were interviewed. Current demonstrations include over 14,000 physicians caring for nearly 5 million patients. A majority of demonstrations are single payer, and most utilize a three component payment model (traditional fee for service, per person per month fixed payments, and bonus performance payments). The median incremental revenue per physician per year was $22,834 (range $720 to $91,146). Two major practice transformation models were identified-consultative and implementation of the chronic care model. A majority of demonstrations did not have well-developed evaluation plans. Current PCMH demonstration projects with external payment reform include large numbers of patients and physicians as well as a wide spectrum of implementation models. Key questions exist around the adequacy of current payment mechanisms and evaluation plans as public and policy interest in the PCMH model grows.

Biology and Treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis	GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Review							GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE; ANTI-IL-5 MEPOLIZUMAB THERAPY; MAJOR BASIC-PROTEIN; CELIAC-DISEASE; FOOD ALLERGY; SKIN PRICK; CLINICAL-FEATURES; CATIONIC PROTEIN; PATCH TESTS; T-CELLS	Eosinophilic esophagitis is a recently recognized but expanding disorder characterized by antigen-driven eosinophil accumulation in the esophagus. Symptoms frequently mimic those of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but the diseases are distinct in their histopathology, gene expression signature, response to therapy, hereditary risk, and association with allergies. The pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis involves environmental and genetic factors, particularly food antigens and expression level of the eosinophil chemoattractant eotaxin-3, respectively. Analyses of gene expression signatures and animal models have indicated the importance of adaptive T-cell immunity that involves interleukin-5 and interleukin-13-induced esophageal epithelial cell responses. Symptoms, dysregulation of esophageal gene expression, and pathology are largely reversible following reduced exposure to specific food antigens as well as anti-inflammatory therapy, but chronic treatment is necessary to prevent relapse. Therefore, eosinophilic esophagitis is a disease with unique features that include chronic esophagitis, atopy, immune sensitization to oral antigens, reversibility, and familial association.

Nasoseptal flap reconstruction of high flow intraoperative cerebral spinal fluid leaks during endoscopic skull base surgery	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY			English	Article						CSF leak; endoscopic; meningioma; nasoseptal flap; prognosis; reconstruction; sinonasal tumor; skull base; vascularized flap		Background: Over the past 10 years, significant anatomic, technical, and instrumentation advances have facilitated the exposure and resection of intradural lesions via a fully endoscopic expanded endonasal approach (EEA). The vascularized nasoseptal flap (based on the posterior nasoseptal artery) has become our primary endoscopic reconstructive technique. The goals of this study are to prospectively evaluate the nasoseptal flap and high-risk cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak variables. Methods: Prospective evaluation was performed of EEA patients with intraoperative high-flow leaks (either a cistern or ventricle open to nasal cavity during tumor dissection) who underwent nasoseptal flap reconstruction. Results: Seventy consecutive nasoseptal flaps for high-flow intraoperative leaks were evaluated prospectively by the primary author. Twelve risk factors were then graded at the time of the operations and correlated to CSF leak outcomes. The overall postoperative CSF leak rate was 5.7% (4/70). All four postoperative leaks were successfully managed with endoscopic repair and CSF diversion. A multivariate analysis of all 12 risk factors is detailed. Pediatric patients, large dural defects, and radiation therapy were noted to be factors in reconstructive failure. One flap death occurred in a patient with prior surgery and proton therapy, this leak was managed with a temporoparietal flap and endonasal repair. Conclusion: The nasoseptal flap is an excellent anterior skull base reconstructive technique. Patients with high-flow intraoperative CSF leaks had a 94% successful reconstruction rate. Patients with skull base proton radiation therapy are at higher risk for flap failure and preparation for nonradiated tissue reconstruction should be discussed with the patient.

Risk assessment in anaphylaxis: Current and future approaches	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						anaphylaxis; mast cell; basophil; IgE; Fc epsilon RI; histamine; tryptase; most cell carboxypeptidase; allergens; insect venom allergy; food allergy	HYMENOPTERA VENOM ALLERGY; INSECT-STING CHALLENGE; HUMAN MAST-CELLS; FC-EPSILON-RI; BASOPHIL ACTIVATION TEST; PEANUT ALLERGY; FOOD ALLERGY; IN-VITRO; SKIN PRICK; FATAL REACTIONS	Risk assessment of individuals with anaphylaxis is currently hampered by lack of (1) an optimal and readily available laboratory test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode and (2) an optimal method of distinguishing allergen-sensitized individuals who are clinically tolerant from those at risk for anaphylaxis episodes after exposure to the relevant allergen. Our objectives were to review the effector mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis; to explore the possibility of developing an optimal laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode, and the possibility of improving methods to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical reactivity; and to develop a research agenda for risk assessment in anaphylaxis. Researchers from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology held a PRACTALL (Practical Allergy) meeting to discuss these objectives. New approaches being investigated to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis include serial measurements of total tryptase in serum during an anaphylaxis episode, and measurement of baseline total tryptase levels after the episode. Greater availability of the test for mature beta-tryptase, a more specific mast cell activation marker for anaphylaxis than total tryptase, is needed. Measurement of chymase, mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, platelet-activating factor, and other mast cell products may prove to be useful. Consideration should be given to measuring a panel of mediators from mast cells and basophils. New approaches being investigated to help distinguish sensitized individuals at minimum or no risk from those at increased risk of developing anaphylaxis include measurement of the ratio of allergen-specific IgE to total IgE, determination of IgE directed at specific allergenic epitopes, measurement of basophil activation markers by using flow cytometry, and assessment of allergen-specific cytokine responses. Algorithms have been developed for risk assessment of individuals with anaphylaxis, along with a research agenda for studies that could lead to an improved ability to confirm the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis and to identify allergen-sensitized individuals who are at increased risk of anaphylaxis.

Here we report that local pharmacological targeting of the C5a receptor (C5aR) prior to initial allergen sensitization in murine models of inhalation tolerance or allergic asthma resulted in either induction or marked enhancement of Th2-polarized immune responses, airway inflammation, and AHR. Importantly, C5aR-deficient mice exhibited a similar, increased allergic phenotype. Pulmonary allergen exposure in CSaR-targeted mice resulted in increased sensitization and accumulation of CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells associated with a marked increase in pulmonary myeloid, but not plasmacytoid, DC numbers. Pulmonary DCs from C5aR-targeted mice produced large amounts of CC chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22 ex vivo, suggesting a negative impact of C5aR signaling on pulmonary homing of Th2 cells. In contrast, C5aR targeting in sensitized mice led to suppressed airway inflammation and AHR but was still associated with enhanced production of Th2 effector cytokines.

However, models involving short-term high-level exposure of sensitized animals to antigen have significant limitations for investigating the pathogenesis of the lesions of chronic asthma. Modeling chronic asthma is problematic, because long-term antigenic challenge often triggers widespread pulmonary parenchymal inflammation or leads to eventual downregulation of inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. We have developed an improved murine model in which animals are exposed to low mass concentrations of aerosolized antigen for 6-8 wk. The mice exhibit airway-specific acute-on-chronic inflammation and changes of airway wall remodeling as seen in human asthma, together with hyperreactivity to a cholinergic agonist which can be specifically attributed to airway disease. This more realistic model of asthma offers a number of opportunities for investigation of pathogenetic mechanisms and novel therapeutic agents.

Previously, most research in the area of toxicology and environmental and occupational health involved male subjects. The present work aims at reviewing exposure and health effects of cadmium, nickel, lead, mercury, and arsenic manifested differently in women than in men. The gender difference in exposure to nickel results in a much higher prevalence of nickel allergy and hand eczema in women than in men. The internal cadmium dose is generally higher in women than in men, due to a higher gastrointestinal absorption at low iron stores. This was probably one major reason why Itai-itai disease was mainly a woman's disease. Yet, data are sparse regarding the risk for women relative to men to develop cadmium-induced kidney damage in populations exposed to low levels of cadmium. Lead is accumulated mainly in bone and increased endogenous lead exposure has been demonstrated in women during periods of increased bone turnover, e.g., menopause. Both lead and mercury exposure in pregnant women has to be kept low in order to prevent neurodevelopment effects in the developing fetus and child. Limited data indicate that women are more affected than men following exposure to methylmercury at adult age, while males seem to be more sensitive to exposure during early development. Regarding arsenic, some data indicate gender differences in the biotransformation by methylation, possibly also in susceptibility to certain arsenic-related cancers. Obviously, gender-related differences in exposure and health effects caused by metals are highly neglected research areas, which need considerable focus in the future.

Over the past 10 years, the most important allergens from mites, pollens, animal dander, insects, and foods have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed. In many cases the three-dimensional allergen structure has been determined and B-cell and T-cell epitopes have been mapped. These studies show that allergens have diverse biologic functions (they may be enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, lipocalins, or structural proteins) and that as a rule the allergen function is unrelated to its ability to cause IgE antibody responses, High-level expression systems have been developed to produce recombinant allergens in bacteria, yeast, or insect cells. Recombinant allergens show comparable IgE antibody binding to their natural counterparts (where available) and show excellent reactivity on skin testing and in in vitro diagnostic tests. Cocktails of recombinant allergens can be formulated with predetermined and uniform allergen levels, which could replace natural allergens and result in the development of innovative, patient-based tests for allergy diagnosis. Recombinant allergens also offer the exciting possibility of developing new forms of allergen immunotherapy, including the use of hypoallergens, allergens coupled to IgE suppressive adjuvants, and peptide-based therapies. The production of recombinant allergens as defined molecular entities makes it feasible to consider the possibility of developing prophylactic allergen vaccines. The introduction of recombinant allergens in research and in clinical trials should lead to significant improvements in allergy diagnosis and treatment.

Although asthmatic children may develop IgE antibodies against variety of allergens, asthma is associated primarily with allergy to house-dust mites, molds, or other allergens. In this study, me conducted a genome-wide linkage search in 47 Japanese families (197 members) with more than two mite-sensitive atopic asthmatics (65 affected sib-pairs) using 398 markers. Multipoint linkage analysis was carried out for atopic asthma as a qualitative trait using the MAPMAKER/SIB program. We observed signficant evidence for linkage with maximum lod scores (MLS) of 4.8 near the interleukin 12 B gene locus on chromosome 5q31-q33. In addition, suggestive evidence on 4q35 with MLS = 2.7 and on 13q11 with MLS = 2.4 was obtained. The other possible linkage regions included 6p22-p21.3 (MLS = 2.1), 12q21-q23 (MILS = 1.9), and 13q14.1-q14.3 (MLS = 2.0). Many of the linkage loci suggested in this study were at or close to those suggested by genome-wide studies for asthma in Caucasian populations. The present study suggests the contribution of the interleukin 12 B gene or nearby gene(s) to mite-sensitive atopic asthma and a considerable number of genetic variants common across Caucasians and Japanese populations contributing to asthma, although the relative importance of various variants may differ between the groups.

Although the disease can start at any age, the first symptoms occur during childhood in most cases. Asthma has a strong genetic component, and genome-wide association studies have identified variations in several genes that slightly increase the risk of disease. Asthma is often associated with increased susceptibility to infection with rhinoviruses and with changes in the composition of microbial communities colonising the airways, but whether these changes are a cause or consequence of the disease is unknown. There is currently no proven prevention strategy; however, the finding that exposure to microbial products in early life, particularly in farming environments, seems to be protective against asthma offers hope that surrogates of such exposure could be used to prevent the disease. Genetic and immunological studies point to defective responses of lung resident cells, especially those associated with the mucosal epithelium, as crucial elements in the pathogenesis of asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids continue to be the mainstay for the treatment of mild and moderate asthma, but limited adherence to daily inhaled medication is a major obstacle to the success of such therapy. Severe asthma that is refractory to usual treatment continues to be a challenge, but new biological therapies, such as humanised antibodies against IgE, interleukin 5, and interleukin 13, off er hope to improve the quality of life and long-term prognosis of severe asthmatics with specific molecular phenotypes.

Pre-operative computed tomography coronary anglography to detect significant coronary artery disease in patients referred for cardiac valve surgery	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							VALVULAR HEART-DISEASE; PRACTICE GUIDELINES COMMITTEE; ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; AORTIC-STENOSIS; RADIATION-EXPOSURE; ANGINA-PECTORIS; ANGIOGRAPHY; ACCURACY; CT; QUANTIFICATION	OBJECTIVES We studied the diagnostic performance of 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) to rule out or detect significant coronary stenosis in patients referred for valve surgery. BACKGROUND Invasive conventional coronary angiography (CCA) is recommended in most patients scheduled for valve surgery. METHODS During a 6-month period, 145 patients were prospectively identified from a consecutive patient population scheduled for valve surgery. Thirty-five patients were excluded because of CTCA criteria: irregular heart rhythm (n = 26), impaired renal function (n = 5), and known contrast allergy (n = 4). General exclusion criteria were: hospitalization in community hospital (n = 4), no need for CCA (n = 4), previous coronary artery bypass surgery (n = 1), or percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4). Of the remaining 97 patients, 27 denied written informed consent. Thus, the study population comprised 70 patients (49 male, 21 female;, mean age 63 +/- 11 years). RESULTS Prevalence of significant coronary artery disease, defined as having at least 1 >= 50% stenosis per patient, was 25.7%. Beta-blockers were administered in 71%, and 64% received lorazepam. The mean heart rate dropped from 72.5 +/- 12.4 to 59.5 +/- 7.5 beats/min. The mean scan time was 12.8 +/- 1.3 s. On a per-patient analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were: 100% (18 of 18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 78 to 100), 92% (48 of 52; 95% CI 81 to 98), 82% (18 of 22; 95% CI 59 to 94), and 100% (48 of 48; 95% CI 91 to 100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice CTCA for ruling out the presence of significant coronary stenoses in patients undergoing valve surgery is excellent and allows CTCA implementation as a gatekeeper for invasive CCA in these patients.

However, it is not known whether ambient particles (particulate matter(2.5) [PM2.5]) from these areas induce distinct lung inflammation, which might be an explanation for this difference. Therefore, 100 mug of PM2.5 suspensions, collected simultaneously in the two areas, were instilled through a bronchoscope into contralateral lung segments of 12 healthy volunteers. PM2.5 from both Hettstedt and Zerbst increased the number of leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage performed 24 hours later. PM2.5 from Hettstedt, but not Zerbst, induced a significant influx of monocytes (Hettstedt: 7.0% vs. Zerbst: 4.3%) without influencing the expression of surface activation markers on monocytes and alveolar macrophages. Oxidant radical generation of bronchoalveolar lavage cells and cytokine concentration (interieukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was significantly increased after instillation of Hettstedt PM2.5. We conclude that environmentally relevant concentrations of PM2.5 from the smelter area induced distinct airway inflammation in healthy subjects with a selective influx of monocytes and increased generation of oxidant radicals. The higher concentration of transition metals in PM2.5 from Hettstedt might be responsible for this increased inflammation.

Although house dust mite allergen avoidance has been used as a preventive strategy in several trials, the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the primary prevention of asthma and allergic disease is not known. Objective: To measure the effects of dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and house dust mite allergen avoidance in children with a family history of asthma. Methods: A total of 616 children at high risk of asthma were enrolled antenatally in a randomized controlled trial, and 526 children remained in the trial at age 3 years. The outcomes were symptoms of allergic disease and allergen sensitization. Results: There was a significant 10.0% (95% CI, 3.7-16.4) reduction in the prevalence of cough in atopic children in the active diet group (P = .003; number needed to treat, 10) but a negligible 1.1 % (95 % CI, -7.1 to 9.5) reduction cough among nonatopic children. There was a 7.2% (95% CI, 10.11-14.3) reduction in sensitization to house dust mite in the active allergen avoidance group (P = .05; number needed to treat, 14). No significant differences in wheeze were found with either intervention. Conclusion: These results suggest that our interventions, designed to be used in simple public health campaigns, may have a role in preventing the development of allergic sensitization and airways disease in early childhood. This offers the prospect of reducing allergic disease in later life.

It turned out that most allergens could be grouped into a small number of structural protein families, regardless of their biological source. Structural similarity among proteins from diverse sources is the molecular basis of allergic cross-reactivity. The clinical relevance of immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity seems to be influenced by a number of factors including the immune response against the allergen, exposure and the allergen. As individuals are exposed to a variable number of allergenic sources bearing homologous molecules, the exact nature of the antigenic structure inducing the primary IgE immune response cannot be easily defined. In general, the 'cross-reactivity' term should be limited to defined clinical manifestations showing reactivity to a source without previous exposure. 'Co-recognition', including by definition 'cross-reactivity', could be used to describe the large majority of the IgE reactivity where co-exposure to a number of sources bearing homologous molecules do not allow unequivocal identification of the sensitizing molecule. The analysis of reactivity clusters in diagnosis allows the interpretation of the patient's reactivity profile as a result of the sensitization process, which often begins with exposure to a single allergenic molecule.

Current animal models of allergen-induced airway inflammation generally concentrate on the acute inflammation following allergen exposure and fail to mimic all of these features. Objective The aim of this study was to use a murine model of prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation in order to characterize the cells and molecules involved in the ensuing airway remodelling. Moreover, we investigated whether remodelling persists in the absence of continued allergen challenge. Methods Acute pulmonary eosinophilia and airways hyper-reactivity were induced after six serial allergen challenges in sensitized mice (acute phase). Mice were subsequently challenged three times a week with ovalbumin (OVA) (chronic phase) up to day 55. To investigate the persistence of pathology, one group of mice were left for another 4 weeks without further allergen challenge (day 80). Results The extended OVA challenge protocol caused significant airway remodelling, which was absent in the acute phase. Specifically, remodelling was characterized by deposition of collagen as well as airway smooth muscle and goblet cell hyperplasia. Importantly, these airway changes, together with tissue eosinophilia were sustained in the absence of further allergen challenge. Examination of cytokines revealed a dramatic up-regulation of IL-4 and tumour growth factor-beta1 during the chronic phase. Interestingly, while IL-4 levels were significantly increased during the chronic phase, levels of IL-13 fell. Levels of the Th1-associated cytokine IFN-gamma also increased during the chronic phase. Conclusion In conclusion, we have demonstrated that prolonged allergen challenge results in persistent airway wall remodelling.

Estimates reveal that 46% of medication errors occur on admission or discharge from a clinical unit/hospital when patient orders are written. This study was performed to reduce medication errors in patient's discharge orders through a reconciliation process in an adult surgical intensive care unit (ICU). A discharge survey was implemented as part of the medication reconciliation process. The admitting nurse initiated the survey within 24 hours of ICU admission and the charge nurse completed the survey on discharge. Baseline data were obtained through a random sampling of 10% of discharges in first 2 weeks of the study (July 2001-May 2002). Medical and anesthesia records were reviewed, allergies and home medications verified with patient/family and findings compared with orders at time of ICU discharge. Baseline data revealed that 31 of 33 (94%) patients had orders changed. By week 24, nearly all medication errors in discharge orders were eliminated. In conclusion, use of the discharge survey in this medication reconciliation process resulted in a dramatic drop in medications errors for patients discharged from an ICU. The survey is now a part of our electronic medical record and used in 4 adult ICUs and 2 medicine floors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The strongest associations are seen for respiratory and cardiac deaths, particularly among the elderly. Particulate air pollution is also associated with asthma exacerbations, increased respiratory symptoms, decreased lung function, increased medication use, and increased hospital admissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently promulgated a new national ambient air quality standard for fine particles, and yet the mechanisms for health effects at such low particle mass concentrations remain unclear. Hypotheses to identify the responsible particles have focused on particle acidity, particle content of transition metals, bioaerosols, and ultrafine particles. Because ultrafine particles are efficiently deposited in the respiratory tract and may be important in initiating airway inflammation, we have initiated clinical studies with ultrafine carbon particles in healthy subjects. These studies examine the role of ultrafines in: (1) the induction of airway inflammation; (2) expression of leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules in blood; (3) the alteration of blood coagulability; and (4) alteration in cardiac electrical activity. These events could lead to exacerbation of underlying cardiorespiratory disease. For example, airway inflammation may activate endothelium and circulating leukocytes, and induce a systemic acute phase response with transient hypercoagulability; this could explain the epidemiologic linkages between pollutant exposures and cardiovascular events. These approaches should be useful in identifying mechanisms for pollutant-induced respiratory and systemic effects, and in providing data for determining appropriate air quality standards.

Given that during OIT an allergic patient ingests an allergen that could potentially cause a serious reaction, the safety of OIT is of particular concern. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine safety during the initial escalation day, buildup phase, and home dosing phase in subjects enrolled in a peanut OIT study. Methods: Skin, upper respiratory tract, chest, and abdominal symptoms were recorded with initial escalation day and buildup phase dosings. Subjects also maintained daily diaries detailing symptoms after each home dosing. A statistical analysis of these data was performed. Results: Twenty of 28 patients completed all phases of the study. During the initial escalation day, upper respiratory tract (79%) and abdominal (68%) symptoms were the most likely symptoms experienced. The risk of mild wheezing during the initial escalation day was 18%. The probability of having any symptoms after a buildup phase dose was 46%, with a risk of 29% for upper respiratory tract symptoms and 24% for skin symptoms. The risk of reaction with any home dose was 3.5%. Upper respiratory tract (1.2%) and skin (1.1%) symptoms were the most likely after home doses. Treatment was given with 0.7% of home doses. Two subjects received epinephrine after I home dose each. Conclusions: Subjects were more likely to have significant allergic symptoms during the initial escalation day when they were in a closely monitored setting than during other phases of the study. Allergic reactions with home doses were rare. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;124:286-91.)	[Hofmann, Alison M.; Steele, Pamela H.; Kamilaris, Janet; Burks, A.

South African herbal teas: Aspalathus linearis, Cyclopia spp. and Athrixia phylicoides-A review	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Anticarcinogenic; Antioxidant; Bush tea; Chemical composition; Honeybush; Phyto-oestrogenic; Polyphenols; Rooibos	CAMELLIA-SINENSIS TEAS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS; BATCH EXTRACTION CONDITIONS; MAJOR PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; FIXED-BED EXTRACTION; ROOIBOS TEA; HONEYBUSH TEA; AQUEOUS EXTRACTS; BUSH TEA; IN-VITRO	Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis (Brum.f) Dahlg.) and honeybush (Cyclopia Vent. species) are popular indigenous South African herbal teas enjoyed for their taste and aroma. Traditional medicinal uses of rooibos in South Africa include alleviation of infantile colic, allergies, asthma and dermatological problems, while a decoction of honeybush was used as a restorative and as an expectorant in chronic catarrh and pulmonary tuberculosis. Traditional medicinal uses of Athrixia phylicoides DC., or bush tea, another indigenous South African plant with very limited localised use as herbal tea, include treatment of boils, acne, infected wounds and infected throats. Currently rooibos and honeybush are produced for the herbal tea market, while bush tea has potential for commercialisation. A summary of the historical and modern uses, botany, distribution, industry and chemical composition of these herbal teas is presented. A comprehensive discussion of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo biological properties, required to expand their applications as nutraceutical and cosmeceutical products, is included, with the main emphasis on rooibos. Future research needs include more comprehensive chemical characterisation of extracts, identification of marker compounds for extract standardisation and quality control, bioavailability and identification of bio-markers of dietary exposure, investigation of possible herb-drug interactions and plant improvement with regards to composition and bioactivity.

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate the associations between allergic symptoms in children and the concentration of phthalate esters in settled dust collected from children's homes in Sofia and Burgas, Bulgaria. METHODS: Dust samples from the child's bedroom were collected. A total of 102 children (2-7 Years of age) had symptoms of wheezing, rhinitis, and/or eczema in preceding 12 months (cases), and 82 were nonsymptomatic (controls). The dust samples were analyzed for their content of dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP). RESULTS: A higher concentration of DEHP was found in homes of case children than in those of controls (1.24 vs. 0.86 mg/g dust). The concentration of DEHP was significantly associated with wheezing in the preceding 12 months (p = 0.035) as reported by parents. We found a dose-response relationship between DEHP concentration and case status and between DEHP concentration and wheezing in the preceding 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an association between concentration of DEHP in indoor dust and wheezing among preschool children in Bulgaria.

People living or otherwise spending substantial time within about 200 m of highways are exposed to these pollutants more so than persons living at a greater distance, even compared to living on busy urban streets. Evidence of the health hazards of these pollutants arises from studies that assess proximity to highways, actual exposure to the pollutants, or both. Taken as a whole, the health studies show elevated risk for development of asthma and reduced lung function in children who live near major highways. Studies of particulate matter (PM) that show associations with cardiac and pulmonary mortality also appear to indicate increasing risk as smaller geographic areas are studied, suggesting localized sources that likely include major highways. Although less work has tested the association between lung cancer and highways, the existing studies suggest an association as well. While the evidence is substantial for a link between near-highway exposures and adverse health outcomes, considerable work remains to understand the exact nature and magnitude of the risks.			dbrugge@aol.com; john.durant@tufts.edu; Christine.rioux@tufts.edu	Durant, John/F-2424-2017	Durant, John/0000-0002-7016-1622	NIEHS NIH HHS [R01 ES015462]		Adar SD, 2007, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V18, P95, DOI 10.1097/01.ede.0000249409.81050.46; *AM HOUS SURV US, 2003, H15003 AM HOUS SURV; Beeson WL, 1998, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V106, P813, DOI 10.1289/ehp.98106813; Biggeri A, 1996, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V104, P750, DOI 10.2307/3433221; Brauer M, 2007, EUR RESPIR J, V29, P879, DOI 10.1183/09031936.00083406; Brauer M, 2003, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V14, P228, DOI 10.1097/00001648-200303000-00019; Brook RD, 2004, CIRCULATION, V109, P2655, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000128587.30041.C8; Brunekreef B, 1997, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V8, P298, DOI 10.1097/00001648-199705000-00012; Brunekreef B, 2002, LANCET, V360, P1233, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11274-8; Chambers L A, 1976, AIR POLLUTION, V1; Chan CC, 2004, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V112, P1063, DOI 10.1289/chp.6897; Choi KS, 1997, ARCH ENVIRON HEALTH, V52, P160; Chuang KJ, 2005, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V113, P1693, DOI 10.1289/ehp.8145; Delfino RJ, 2005, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V113, P934, DOI 10.1289/ehp.7938; Delfino RJ, 2004, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V112, P932, DOI 10.1289/ehp.6815; DOCKERY DW, 1993, NEW ENGL J MED, V329, P1753, DOI 10.1056/NEJM199312093292401; English P, 1999, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V107, P761, DOI 10.2307/3434663; Finkelstein MM, 2005, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V59, P481, DOI 10.1136/jech.2004.026203; Fischer PH, 2000, ATMOS ENVIRON, V34, P3713, DOI 10.1016/S1352-2310(00)00067-4; Gauderman WJ, 2007, LANCET, V369, P571, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60037-3; Gauderman WJ, 2000, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V162, P1383; Gauderman WJ, 2004, NEW ENGL J MED, V351, P1057, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa040610; Gauderman WJ, 2005, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V16, P737, DOI 10.1097/01.ede.00001813087.51440.75; Graedel T.

Synergistic effects of traffic-related air pollution and exposure to violence on urban asthma etiology	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						childhood asthma; exposure to violence (ETV); geographic information systems (GIS); intraurban variability; nitrogen dioxide (NO2); social-environmental synergy; stress	COMMUNITY VIOLENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; HEALTH DISPARITIES; STRESS REACTIVITY; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; LUNG-FUNCTION; BIRTH-COHORT; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION; SYMPTOMS	BACKGROUND: Disproportionate-life stress and consequent physiologic alteration (i.e., immune dysregulation) has been proposed as a major pathway linking socioeconomic position, environmental exposures, and health disparities. Asthma, for example, disproportionately affects lower-income urban communities, where air pollution and social stressors may be elevated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the role of exposure to violence (ETV), as a chronic stressor, in altering susceptibility to traffic-related air pollution in asthma etiology. METHODS: We developed geographic information systems (GIS)-based models to retrospectively estimate residential exposures to traffic-related pollution for 413 children in a community-based pregnancy cohort, recruited in East Boston, Massachusetts, between 1987 and 1993, using monthly nitrogen dioxide measurements for 13 sites over 18 years. We merged pollution estimates with questionnaire data on lifetime ETV and examined the effects of both on childhood asthma etiology. RESULTS: Correcting for potential confounders, we found an elevated risk of asthma with a 1-SD (4.3 ppb) increase in NO2 exposure solely among children with above-median ETV [odds ratio (OR) = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (0), 1.14-2-33)]. Among children always living in the same community, with lesser exposure measurement error, this association was magnified (OR = 2.40; 95% Cl, 1.48-3.88). Of multiple exposure periods, year-of-diagnosis NO2 was most predictive of asthma, outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between traffic-related air pollution and asthma solely among urban children exposed to violence. Future studies should consider socially patterned susceptibility, common spatial distributions of social and physical environmental factors, and potential synergies among these. Prospective assessment of physical and social exposures may help determine causal pathways and critical exposure periods.

Methods: Children were seen at birth, and at 1, 2, 4, and 10 years of age in a whole-population birth cohort study (1,456 subjects). Information was collected prospectively on genetic and environmental risk factors. Skin-prick testing was performed at 4 years of age. Current wheeze (in the last 12 months) and currently diagnosed asthma (CDA) [ie, current wheeze and ever-diagnosed asthmatic subject] were recorded at 10 years of age when BHR was measured at bronchial challenge. Independent significant risk factors for these outcomes were identified by logistic regression. Results: Independent significance for current wheeze occurred with maternal asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 3.41) and paternal asthma (OR,. 2.12; 95% CI 1.29 to 3.51), recurrent chest infections at 2 years (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.36 to 6.70), atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.36 to 5.76), eczema at 4 years of age (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.73), and parental smoking at 4 years of age (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.81). For CDA, significant factors were maternal asthma (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.73), paternal asthma (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.52), and sibling asthma (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.43), recurrent chest infections at I year of age (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.40) and 2 years of age (OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.06 to S. IS), atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 7.22; 95% CI, 4.13 to 12.62), parental smoking at I year of age (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.45), and male gender (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95). For BHR, atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 5.38; 95% CI, 3.06 to 9.47) and high social class at birth (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.53) proved to be significant. Conclusions: Asthmatic heredity, predisposition to early life atopy, plus early passive smoke exposure and recurrent chest infections are important influences for the occurrence of wheeze and asthma at 10 years of age. BHR at 10 years of age has a narrower risk profile, suggesting that factors influencing wheezing symptom expression may differ from those predisposing the patient to BHR.

Because few studies have investigated this relationship, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a workshop in May 2002 to help develop a scientific research agenda on these issues. Workshop participants' areas of expertise included physical activity, injury prevention, air pollution, water quality, urban planning, transportation, architecture, epidemiology, land use, mental health, social capital, housing, and social marketing. This report describes the 37 questions in the resulting research agenda. The next steps are to define priorities and obtain resources. The proposed research will help identify the best practices for designing new communities and revitalizing old ones in ways that promote physical and mental health.

We have assessed the epidemiological evidence in support of this hypothesis. No longitudinal studies were identified in which allergen exposure during infancy in a random population sample has been related to asthma risk after the age of six years. Two studies have been conducted in selected populations chosen on the basis of a family history of asthma or allergy; one study found a nonstatistically significant association whereas the other study found no association. Many of the identified prevalence studies in children showed negative associations between allergen exposure and current asthma, and the weighted averages of the population attributable risks in children were 4% for Der p 1, 11% for Fel d 1, -4% for Bla g 2, and 6% for Can f 1. There was little change in these estimates in studies in which children whose parents had adopted allergen avoidance measures were excluded. Furthermore, evidence from population studies is equivocal and provides little consistent evidence that allergen exposure is associated with the prevalence of asthma at the population level. Population-based cohort studies are clearly required, but currently available evidence does not indicate that allergen exposure is a major risk factor for the primary causation of asthma in children.

The function of Fc gamma receptors in dendritic cells and macrophages	NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							CYTOPLASMIC DOMAIN HETEROGENEITY; ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT; DENGUE HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; IGG IMMUNE-COMPLEXES; RII-MEDIATED UPTAKE; DUST MITE ALLERGEN; CD8(+) T-CELLS; ANTIGEN PRESENTATION; IN-VIVO; CROSS-PRESENTATION	Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages use various receptors to recognize foreign antigens and to receive feedback control from adaptive immune cells. Although it was long believed that all immunoglobutin Fc receptors are universally expressed by phagocytes, recent findings indicate that only monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages express high levels of activating Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma Rs), whereas conventional and plasmacytoid DCs express the inhibitory Fc gamma R. In this Review, we discuss how the uptake, processing and presentation of antigens by DCs and macrophages is influenced by Fc gamma R recognition of innmunoglobulins and immune complexes in the steady state and during inflammation.

Our aim was to determine the effects of these two factors on the risk of asthma in the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) and the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) birth cohorts. METHODS We tested genotypes at the 17q21 locus for associations with asthma and with human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) wheezing illnesses and tested for interactions between 17q21 genotypes and HRV and RSV wheezing illnesses with respect to the risk of asthma. Finally, we examined genotype-specific expression of 17q21 genes in unstimulated and HRV-stimulated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS The 17q21 variants were associated with HRV wheezing illnesses in early life, but not with RSV wheezing illnesses. The associations of 17q21 variants with asthma were restricted to children who had had HRV wheezing illnesses, resulting in a significant interaction effect with respect to the risk of asthma. Moreover, the expression levels of ORMDL3 and of GSDMB were significantly increased in HRV-stimulated PBMCs, as compared with unstimulated PBMCs. The expression of these genes was associated with 17q21 variants in both conditions, although the increase with exposure to HRV was not genotype-specific. CONCLUSIONS Variants at the 17q21 locus were associated with asthma in children who had had HRV wheezing illnesses and with expression of two genes at this locus. The expression levels of both genes increased in response to HRV stimulation, although the relative increase was not associated with the 17q21 genotypes.

Conversely, lung DCs can also mount maladaptive Th2 immune responses to harmless allergens and, in this way, contribute to immunopathology. It is now clear that the various aspects of DC biology can be understood only if we take into account the functional specializations of different DC subsets that are present in the lung in homeostasis or are attracted to the lung as part of the inflammatory response to inhaled noxious stimuli. Lung DCs are heavily influenced by the nearby epithelial cells, and a model is emerging whereby direct communication between DCs and epithelial cells determines the outcome of the pulmonary immuneresponse. Here, we have approached DC biology from the perspective of viral infection and allergy to illustrate these emerging concepts.

Exercise-induced asthma, respiratory and allergic disorders in elite athletes: epidemiology, mechanisms and diagnosis: Part I of the report from the Joint Task Force of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) in cooperation with GA(2)LEN	ALLERGY			English	Review						asthma; allergy; bronchial responsiveness; sports; exercise-induced asthma	CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS; HYPERVENTILATION-INDUCED ASTHMA; ICE HOCKEY PLAYERS; BRONCHIAL RESPONSIVENESS; INDUCED BRONCHOSPASM; INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS; COLD-AIR; INDUCED HYPOXEMIA	Aims: To analyze the changes in the prevalence of asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and allergies in elite athletes over the past years, to review the specific pathogenetic features of these conditions and to make recommendations for their diagnosis. Mehtods: The Task Force reviewed present literature by searching Medline up to November 2006 for relevant papers by the search words: asthma, bronchial responsiveness, EIB, athletes and sports. Sign criteria were used to assess level of evidence and grades of recommendation. Results: The problems of sports-related asthma and allergy are outlined. Epidemiological evidence for an increased prevalence of asthma and BHR among competitive athletes, especially in endurance sports, is provided. The mechanisms for development of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in athletes are outlined. Criteria are given for the diagnosis of asthma and exercise induced asthma in the athlete. Conclusions: The prevalence of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness is markedly increased in athletes, especially within endurance sports. Environmental factors often contribute. Recommendations for the diagnosis of asthma in athletes are outlined.	[Carlsen, K. H.] Univ Oslo, Rikshosp, Fac Med, Dept Paediat,Med Ctr, NO-0791 Oslo, Norway; [Carlsen, K.

IN-VIVO; TGF-BETA; CUTTING EDGE; DENDRITIC CELLS; DEPENDENT MECHANISMS; SUPPRESSOR FUNCTION; IMMUNE PATHOLOGY; CD4(+)CD25(+); CD25(+)	Regulatory T (T-R) cells are a subset of T cells that function to control immune responses. Different populations of T-R cells have been described, including thymically derived CD4(+)CD25(+) T-R cells and TO cells induced in the periphery through exposure to antigen. A transcription factor, Foxp3, has been identified that is essential for CD4(+)CD25(+) T-R cell development and function. There is now evidence that transforming growth factor-beta might play a role in this pathway. CD4(+)CD25(+) T-R cells proliferate extensively in vivo in an antigen-specific manner, and can respond to both self and foreign peptides. By suppressing excessive immune responses, T-R cells play a key role in the maintenance of self-tolerance, thus preventing autoimmune disease, as well as inhibiting harmful inflammatory diseases such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods: In order to assess the prevalence of GOLD stages of COPD in high income countries and to evaluate their association with the known risk factors for airflow obstruction, data from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey on more than 18 000 young adults (20-44 years) were analysed. Results: The overall prevalence was 11.8% (95% CI 11.3 to 12.3) for stage 0, 2.5% (95% CI 2.2 to 2.7) for stage I, and 1.1% (95% CI 1.0 to 1.3) for stages II-III. Moderate to heavy smoking (greater than or equal to15 pack years) was significantly associated with both stage 0 (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 4.15; 95% CI 3.55 to 4.84) and stages I+ (RRR = 4.09; 95% CI 3.17 to 5.26), while subjects with stages I+ COPD had a higher likelihood of giving up smoking (RRR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.86) than those with GOLD stage 0 (RRR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Environmental tobacco smoke had the same degree of positive association in both groups. Respiratory infections in childhood and low socioeconomic class were significantly and homogeneously associated with both groups, whereas occupational exposure was significantly associated only with stage 0. All the GOLD stages showed a significantly higher percentage of healthcare resource users than healthy subjects (p < 0.001), with no difference between stage 0 and COPD. Conclusions: A considerable percentage of young adults already suffered from COPD. GOLD stage 0 was characterised by the presence of the same risk factors as COPD and by the same high demand for medical assistance.

Data from 1,332 term and normal weight neonates, from an ongoing birth cohort study, Influences of life-style related factors on the immune system and the development of allergies in childhood (LISA), with complete information on exposure to biocontaminants in mattress dust and CB-IgE were analysed. Two thirds of CB-IgE were undetectable (<0.35 kU(.)L(-1)). Thus, 0.35 and 0.45 kU(.)L(-1) (4th quartile) were chosen as cut-offs. Nonparametric smoothing (generalised additive models) showed statistically significant confounder-adjusted associations between elevated CB-IgE levels (greater than or equal to0.45 kU(.)L(-1)) and log-transformed exposures to cat (linear), mite (inverse u-shaped), and endotoxin (u-shaped). After adjustment for covariables, elevated CB-IgE levels (logistic regression using the 1st-4th quartiles of exposure) were positively associated with high cat-allergen exposure and medium exposure to mite allergen, but were inversely associated with exposure to endotoxin. The associations were similar, but somewhat weaker, when 0.35 kU(.)L(-1) was used as cut-off. These results, showing an association between prenatal allergen and endotoxin exposures and immunoglobulin E production, suggest that the development of foetal immune responses may be affected.

Chronic exposure to significant levels of LPS is reported to be associated with the development and/or progression of many types of lung diseases, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, and progressive irreversible airflow obstruction, that are all characterized by chronic inflammatory processes in the lung. In the present study, pathologic effects of long-term LPS exposure to the lung were investigated in detail. To this end, a murine model in which mice were exposed to repeated intratracheal instillation of Escherichia coli LPS was developed. We show that long-term LPS instillation in mice results in persistent chronic pulmonary inflammation, characterized by peribronchial and perivascular lymphocytic aggregates (CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD19(+)), parenchymal accumulation of macrophages and CD8+ T cells, and altered cytokine expression. Furthermore, airway and alveolar alterations such as mucus cell metaplasia, airway wall thickening, and irreversible alveolar enlargement accompanied the chronic inflammatory response. Interestingly, the observed inflammatory and pathologic changes mimic changes observed in human subjects with chronic inflammatory lung diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting that this murine model could be applicable to dissect the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of these disease conditions.

Objective: We sought to better understand the home environmental and Lifestyle factors influencing house dust endotoxin levels, Methods: From the homes of 86 infants with wheeze in metropolitan Denver, Colorado, house dust endotoxin (detected with a standardized Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay) and common indoor allergen (Fel d 1, Can f 1, Her p 1, Her f 1, and Bla g 1) contents were quantified. Comprehensive home environment and lifestyle questionnaires were completed during home visits by trained study staff and parents. Results: House dust endotoxin levels were associated with only 2 home environmental features: animals in the home and the presence of central air conditioning. The strongest positive associations were found with animals in the home, Interestingly,the homes without cats or other animals revealed a negative correlation between house dust Fel d 1 and endotoxin (P = .03), Central air conditioning, especially during months of typical use, was associated with lower house dust endotoxin levels, No significant associations between house dust endotoxin levels and home dampness, number of household inhabitants or young children, cleaning frequency, or presence of tobacco smokers in the home were found, Conclusions: Indoor endotoxin exposure can be increased by the presence of animals in the home and decreased with central air conditioning, In some homes without animals, where allergen exposure adequate for sensitization still occurs, there are lower levels of house dust endotoxin, Therefore in homes without animals, factors that influence allergen and endotoxin levels in house dust probably differ, Households with detectable allergen levels but low endotoxin levels may provide a predisposing environment for animal allergen sensitization.

Sensitization and exposure to cockroach allergens is associated with increased asthma morbidity in the United States, especially among lower socioeconomic groups, including African American and Hispanic populations. Exposure to cockroach allergens in the first 3 months of life has been associated with repeated wheezing and asthma. The principal domestic cockroach species are Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana. Both species produce several potent allergens, including Bla g 2 (inactive aspartic proteinase), Bla g 4 (calycin), Bla g 5 (glutathione-S-transferase), the group 1 cross-reactive allergens Bla g 1 and Per a 1, and tropomyosin. Structural homology between tropomyosins from cockroaches, mites, and shrimp may explain clinical cases of the oral allergy syndrome. The 3-dimensional structures of several cockroach allergens are known, and biologically active recombinant allergens have been produced in high-level expression vectors. The use of recombinant cockroach allergens should allow mechanisms of cockroach-induced asthma to be investigated and may lead to the development of new approaches to asthma treatment. Environmental allergen measurements of Bla g 1 and Bla g 2 have allowed exposure levels that cause allergic sensitization to be established. Abatement studies have shown that a sustained decrease in cockroach allergen levels is difficult but can be accomplished by professional application of insecticides, together with rigorous household cleaning. Cockroach asthma is an important public health problem that affects patients who are the least likely to be compliant with treatment with asthma medications or environmental control. Patient education, improvements in the housing stock, and improvements in environmental and immunologic treatment strategies are likely to be the most successful approaches to reduce the prevalence of cockroach-induced asthma.

Patients had a methacholine inhalation test and a bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies before and after an 8-wk treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP), 1,000 mu g/day. Baseline FEV1 (mean +/- SEM) was normal and similar in both groups (RDA: 98.1 +/- 2.7, LSA: 94.5 +/- 4.6%). Geometric mean methacholine PC20 was lower in LSA than in RDA (0.44 versus 3.37 mg/ml) at baseline and improved similarly by 1.85 and 1.86 double concentrations with FP treatment. PC20 normalized (greater than or equal to 16 mg/ml) in five patients with RDA and two patients with LSA. Baseline mean bronchial cell counts (per mm(2) connective tissue surface) for CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD25(+), EG1(+), CD45ro(+), and AA1(+) cells were similar in both groups. With FP, EG1(+) (p < 0.001), EG2(+) (p = 0.018), and AA1(+) counts (p = 0.009) decreased significantly in both groups while CD45ro(+) (p = 0.02) counts decreased only in LSA. Baseline type 1 and type 3 collagen deposition underneath the basement membrane was similar in RDA and LSA and did not change significantly after FP. This study shows that recent compared to long-standing mild asthma is associated with a similar degree of airway inflammation and subepithelial fibrosis, and a similar improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness after 8 wk on high-dose ICS. It also indicates that once asthma becomes symptomatic, airway responsiveness cannot normalize in most subjects over such a time period, even with a high dose of ICS.

It has been shown that fractal trees can be space filling(1) and can ensure minimal dissipation(2-4). The bronchial tree of most mammalian lungs is a good example of an efficient distribution system with an approximate fractal structure(5,6). Here we present a study of the compatibility between physical optimization and physiological robustness in the design of the human bronchial tree. We show that this physical optimization is critical in the sense that small variations in the geometry can induce very large variations in the net air flux. Maximum physical efficiency therefore cannot be a sufficient criterion for the physiological design of bronchial trees. Rather, the design of bronchial trees must be provided with a safety factor and the capacity for regulating airway calibre. Paradoxically, our results suggest that bronchial malfunction related to asthma is a necessary consequence of the optimized efficiency of the tree structure.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; INTERCONTINENTAL TRANSPORT; POLLUTION; ASTHMA; POLLUTANTS; EXPOSURE; HEALTH	Ozone is an air quality problem today for much of the world's population. Regions can exceed the ozone air quality standards (AQS) through a combination of local emissions, meteorology favoring pollution episodes, and the clean-air baseline levels of ozone upon which pollution builds. The IPCC 2001 assessment studied a range of global emission scenarios and found that all but one projects increases in global tropospheric ozone during the 21st century. By 2030, near-surface increases over much of the northern hemisphere are estimated to be about 5 ppb (+2 to +7 ppb over the range of scenarios). By 2100 the two more extreme scenarios project baseline ozone increases of >20 ppb, while the other four scenarios give changes of -4 to +10 ppb. Even modest increases in the background abundance of tropospheric ozone might defeat current AQS strategies. The larger increases, however, would gravely threaten both urban and rural air quality over most of the northern hemisphere.

We followed up 448 children, who had at least one parent with a history of atopy, from birth to 5 years. Among children whose mothers had no history of asthma, exposure to a cat or a Fel d 1 concentration of at least 8 mug/g at the age of 2-3 months was associated with a reduced risk of wheezing between the ages of 1 and 5 years. However, among children whose mothers did have a history of asthma, such exposures were associated with an increased risk of wheezing at or after the age of 3 years. There was no association between wheezing and exposure to dog or dog allergen, and the father's allergy status had no effect on the relation between childhood wheezing and cat exposure.

We hypothesized that levels of eicosanolds in exhaled air condensate are abnormal in patients with AIA and that they change in patients receiving steroid therapy. We measured cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs), prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), and leukotriene B-4 (LTB4), and also 8-isoprostane as a marker of oxidative stress, by enzyme immunoassay in exhaled breath condensate from patients with AIA (17 steroid naive; mean age, 41 +/- 23 years; FEV1, 63%pred), 26 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) (11 steroid naive; mean age, 47 +/- 18 years; FEV1, 69%pred), and 16 healthy subjects (mean age, 45 +/- 17 years; FEV1, 93%pred). Cys-LTs were significantly higher in steroid-naive patients with Al compared with steroid-naive patients with ATA and healthy subjects (152.3 +/- 30.4 and 36.6 +/- 7.1 versus 19.4 +/- 2.8 pg/ml; p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). Steroid-naive patients with AIA also had higher levels of 8-isoprostane than normal subjects (131.8 +/- 31.0 versus 21.9 +/- 4.5 pg/ml; p < 0.05). There were significantly lower levels of both cys-LTs and 8-isoprostanes in steroid-treated patients with AIA. There was no difference in either the PGE(2) or LTB4 level between the patient groups. This is the first study to show that cys-LTs and 8-isoprostanes are elevated in expired breath condensate of steroid-naive patients with AIA, and that cys-LTs are decreased in steroid-treated patients.

Socio-economic factors, such as inequality in health, are also to be addressed. The project started in February 1994. To reach sufficient power, 4,000 children had to be included. In November 1996, this number was reached (4,093). Inclusion in the study was made at 3-4 months of age. At that time, and before induction of allergic disease/asthma of the child, a questionnaire focused on exposure, genetics and socio-economic factors was answered. Settled dust was sampled for later analysis of furred animal and mite allergens. When the children were aged both 1 and 2 years, their parents were asked to fill in new questionnaires focusing on respiratory and allergic (skin, gastrointestinal) symptoms, but also key variables of exposure. Cases with asthma are identified and, for every case, two matched controls drawn. During the following winter, the homes of cases and controls were investigated and the temperature, indoor humidity, air change rate and NO2 measured. Two hundred cases (5%) were expected to be identified during the first 2 years of the children's lives. Some 479 homes have now been investigated and 97.7% of the original 4,093 children still remain in the cohort. The 2-year symptom follow-up ended in November 1998. The 4-year follow-up started on 1 September 1998 and was planned to be finished in June 2000. Questionnaires (allergic and respiratory symptoms, key variables of exposure at home and day care) are sent out to all 4,093 families. All children are invited for examination, lung function tests (PEF, flow-volume, MVV and oxygen clearance) and physical performance. Blood is taken from all children (20 ml). Allergy screening is performed and specific IgE examined. Blood cells will be frozen to allow for later DNA extraction. In subsets (children with any allergic and/or respiratory manifestation and controls), markers of inflammation in blood and urine will be examined, as well as eosinophils in nasal smear. Interviews are carried out to assess the severity of asthma, type/periodicity of health care given, asthma medication and parental sick leave when appropriate. As a separate project, financed by the EU, outdoor pollution as risk factors for asthma and allergies are to be studied within the BAMSE cohort. A follow-up of 8-9 years is underway.

However, it remains uncertain whether living on a farm in childhood is associated with a decreased risk of atopic diseases in adulthood. We analyzed data from 6,251 randomly selected adults 20 to 44 yr of age participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). Subjects answered a detailed questionnaire and underwent specific IgE measurements to five allergens. After adjustment for potential confounders, including pet exposure in childhood, number of siblings, severe respiratory infection in childhood, and parental history of allergy, living on a farm in childhood was associated with a reduced risk of atopic sensitization in adulthood (OR = 0.76, Cl 95% = 0.60-0.97). Compared with other adults, those who had lived on a farm as a child were less frequently sensitized to cat (OR = 0.63, Cl 95% = 0.41-0.96) and to Timothy grass (OR = 0.68, Cl 95% = 0.50-0.94), and were at lower risk of having nasal symptoms in the presence of pollen (OR = 0.80, Cl 95% = 0.64-1.02). The protective effect of farming environment in childhood observed in this population-based sample of young adults provides evidence in favor of the hypothesis that environmental factors encountered in childhood may have a lifelong protective effect against the development of allergy.

To determine the factors responsible, animal models that closely mimic natural modes of allergen exposure should prove most informative. Therefore, we investigated the role of IL-4, a known Th2-promoting cytokine, in generation of Th2 responses after exposure of either the skin or airway to soluble protein. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, IL-4-deficient (IL-4(-/-)) mice showed markedly impaired Th2 activation after primary exposure to inhaled ovalbumin (OVA), with decreased OVA-specific IgG1 and IgE, and significantly fewer eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid after airway challenge. In contrast, IL-4(-/-) mice initially exposed to epicutaneous (e.c.) OVA mounted Th2 responses equivalent to responses in WT mice, with high numbers of eosinophils in BAL fluid. Because Th2 responses were not induced by e.c. OVA exposure in Stat6(-/-) mice (mice lacking signal transducer and activator of transcription 6), the role of IL-13 was tested. In vivo depletion of IL-13 prevented Th2 responses induced by e.c. OVA exposure in IL-4(-/-) mice.

Drowning in disinfection byproducts? Assessing swimming pool water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Review							DRINKING-WATER; MUTATION SPECTRA; BIRTH-WEIGHT; TRIHALOMETHANE CONCENTRATIONS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; NITROGEN TRICHLORIDE; CHEMICAL-IONIZATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SALMONELLA TA100	Disinfection is mandatory for swimming pools: public pools are usually disinfected by gaseous chlorine or sodium hypochlorite and cartridge filters; home pools typically use stabilized chlorine. These methods produce a variety of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which are regulated carcinogenic DBPs in drinking water that have been detected in the blood and breath of swimmers and of nonswimmers at indoor pools. Also produced are halogenated acetic acids (HAAs) and haloketones, which irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes; trichloramine, which is linked with swimming-pool-associated asthma; and halogenated derivatives of UV sun screens, some of which show endocrine effects. Precursors of DBPs include human body substances, chemicals used in cosmetics and sun screens, and natural organic matter. Analytical research has focused also on the identification of an additional portion of unknown DBPs using gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS with derivatization. Children swimmers have an increased risk of developing asthma and infections of the respiratory tract and ear. A 1.6-2.0-fold increased risk for bladder cancer has been associated with swimming or showering/bathing with chlorinated water. Bladder cancer risk from THM exposure (all routes combined) was greatest among those with the GSTT1-1 gene. This suggests a mechanism involving distribution of THMs to the bladder by dermal/inhalation exposure and activation there by GSTT1-1 to mutagens. DBPs may be reduced by engineering and behavioral means, such as applying new oxidation and filtration methods, reducing bromide and iodide in the source water, increasing air circulation in indoor pools, and assuring the cleanliness of swimmers. The positive health effects gained by swimming can be increased by reducing the potential adverse health risks.

The immune system also acts to ensure tolerance to 'self', to food and other environmental components, and to commensal bacteria. A breakdown in the tolerogenic pathways can also lead to inflammatory diseases. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases, including atopic disorders, has increased over the last 60 years. The development of tolerance is the result of active immune mechanisms and both development and maintenance of tolerance are lifelong processes which start very early in life, even prenatally. Profound immunologic changes occur during pregnancy, involving a polarization of T helper (Th) cells towards a dominance of Th2 and regulatory T cell effector responses in both mother and fetus. This situation is important to maintain pregnancy through avoidance of the rejection of the immunologically incompatible fetus. During the third trimester of human pregnancy, fetal T cells are able to mount antigen-specific responses to environmental and food-derived antigens and antigen-specific T cells are detectable in cord blood in virtually all newborns indicating in utero sensitization. If the neonatal immune system is not able to down-regulate the pre-existing Th2 dominance effectively then an allergic phenotype may develop. Changes occur at, and soon after, birth in order that the immune system of the neonate becomes competent and functional and that the gut becomes colonized with bacteria. Exposure to bacteria during birth and from the mother's skin and the provision of immunologic factors in breast milk are amongst the key events that promote maturation of the infant's gut and gut-associated and systemic immune systems. The introduction of formula and of solid foods exposes the infant to novel food antigens and also affects the gut flora. Nutrition may be the source of antigens to which the immune system must become tolerant, provide factors, including nutrients, that themselves might modulate immune maturation and responses, and provide factors that influence intestinal flora, which in turn will affect antigen exposure, immune maturation and immune responses. Through these mechanisms it is possible that nutrition early in life might affect later immune competence, the ability to mount an appropriate immune response upon infection, the ability to develop a tolerogenic response to 'self' and to benign environmental antigens, and the development of immunologic disorders. A Workshop held in February 2006 considered recent findings in the areas of oral tolerance, routes of sensitization to allergens and factors affecting the development of atopic disease; factors influencing the maturation of dendritic cells and the development of regulatory T cells; the influence of gut microflora on immunity, allergic sensitization and infectious disease; the role of nutrition in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in an animal model of preterm birth; and the role of PUFA of different classes in influencing immune responses and in shaping the development of atopic disease. This report summarizes the content of the lectures and the subsequent discussions.

Among infants whose mothers had physician-diagnosed asthma, neither dust mite allergen nor dog allergen was associated with either symptom. Exposure to cockroach allergen (Bla g 1 at greater than or equal to2 U/g) modestly increased the risk for wheeze (odds ratio (OR)=1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 3.71), and exposure to cat allergen modestly decreased the risk (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.03). Among infants of mothers with no asthma history, exposure to gas stoves (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.15) and wood-burning stoves (OR=2.09, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.91) increased the risk of persistent cough. Similarly, measured nitrogen dioxide concentration was associated with persistent cough (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.40). Persistent mold affected both infants of mothers with asthma (for wheeze, OR=2.27, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.07; for cough, OR=1.83, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.22) and infants of mothers without asthma (for cough, OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.31). Reported exposure was confirmed by an association of measured fungi with wheeze (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.49).

However, definitive evidence of their role in the etiology of asthma requires a randomized controlled trial. Objective: We hypothesized that the incidence of asthma and allergy in high-risk children would be reduced by avoidance of HDM allergens, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, or the combination of these strategies. We present the results of an interim analysis reporting outcomes assessed at 18 months. Methods: A total of 616 pregnant women were randomized to an HDM avoidance intervention, comprising the use of impermeable mattress covers and an acaricide or control and the use of an oil supplement, margarines, and cooking oils containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids or control. Atopic status was measured by skin prick testing. Symptoms, diagnoses, and medication histories were elicited by means of parental interviews. Results: The diet intervention resulted in a 9.8% absolute reduction (95% CI, 1.5-18.1; P =.02) in the prevalence of any wheeze and a 7.8% absolute reduction (95% CI, 0.5-15.1, P =.04) in prevalence of wheeze of >1 week, but it had no effect on serum IgE, atopy, or doctors' diagnosis of asthma. The HDM avoidance intervention did not affect these outcomes but was associated with a lower use of oral steroids. Conclusion: Increasing dietary omega-3 fatty acids might have a beneficial effect on the prevalence of wheeze during the first 18 months of life. Follow-up to age 5 years, when the effect of the interventions on asthma risk will be assessed, is underway.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the associations between housing characteristics related to dampness, mold exposure, and house dust mite levels and adult asthma in 38 study centers from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey. Methods: Data about the present home, heating and ventilation systems, double glazing, floor covers, recent water damage, and mold exposure were obtained by means of an interviewer-led questionnaire. The associations between these factors and asthma, as defined on the basis of symptoms in the last year, and of bronchial responsiveness, as determined with methacholine challenge, were evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by using random-effects meta-analyses adjusted within study centers for sex, age group, and smoking status. Results: Fitted carpets and rugs in the bedroom were related to fewer asthma symptoms and bronchial responsiveness (OR range, 0.69-0.91). This effect was consistent across centers and more pronounced among house dust mite-sensitized individuals. Reported mold exposure in the last year was associated with asthma symptoms and bronchial responsiveness (OR range, 1.14-1.44). This effect was homogeneous among centers and stronger in subjects sensitized to Cladosporium species. In centers with a higher prevalence of asthma, the prevalence of reported indoor mold exposure was also high. This association was observed for reported mold exposure by asthmatic subjects (Spearman r(s) = 0.46), as well as reported mold exposure by nonasthmatic subjects (r(s) = 0.54). Reported mold exposure was highest in older houses with recent water damage. Conclusion: We conclude that indoor mold growth has an adverse effect on adult asthma.

However, the role of atopy-susceptibility genes in the development and expression of asthma and allergic disorders is not understood. Objective: We sought to study the familial aggregation and co-occurrence of atopic phenotypes within family members of patients with asthma and to identify chromosomal regions that may contain genes that regulate different atopic phenotypes. Methods: In 200 families (n = 1174) ascertained through a proband with asthma, genome-wide screen and linkage analysis was performed for the following atopic phenotypes: (1) specific IgE to common aeroallergens (Phadiatop assay); (2) specific IgE to Der p 1; (3) positive skin test responses to house dust mite; (4) positive skin test responses to 1 or more of 16 allergens; and (5) peripheral blood eosinophils. Results were compared with the linkage results for total serum IgE levels. Results: There was clear familial aggregation of atopy. A high total serum IgE level in combination with a positive Phadiatop result or a normal total IgE level in combination with a negative Phadiatop result was found in 56.1% of the probands and 66.9% of the offspring. Several chromosomal regions that showed evidence for linkage to an atopic phenotype (ie, 2q, 6p, 7q, and 13q) also showed evidence of linkage with total serum IgE (Xu et al. Am J Hum Genet 2000;67:1163-73). Specific regions of interest for atopic traits were also detected on chromosomes 11q, 17q, and 22q. Conclusions: Atopic phenotypes show familial aggregation, although family members may differ in expression of atopy. Specific chromosomal regions appear to be important in susceptibility to different phenotypes of atopic responsiveness.

To plan effective interventions to reverse this trend we need a better understanding of the risk factors for asthma in early life. This study was undertaken to measure the prevalence of, and risk factors for, asthma in preschool children. Methods-Parents of children aged 3-5 years living in two cities (Lismore, n=383; Wagga Wagga, n=591) in New South Wales, Australia were surveyed by questionnaire to ascertain the presence of asthma and various proposed risk factors for asthma in their children. Recent asthma was defined as ever having been diagnosed with asthma and having cough or wheeze in the last 12 months and having used an asthma medication in the last 12 months. Atopy was measured by skin prick tests to six common allergens. Results-The prevalence of recent asthma was 22% in Lismore and 18% in Wagga Wagga. Factors which increased the risk of recent asthma were: atopy (odds ratio (OR) 2.35, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.72), having a parent with a history of asthma (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.16), having had a serious respiratory infection in the first 2 years of life (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.99), and a high dietary intake of polyunsaturated fats (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.60). Breast feeding (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) and having three or more older siblings (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.71) decreased the risk of recent asthma. Conclusions-Of the factors tested, those that have the greatest potential to be modified to reduce the risk of asthma are breast feeding and consumption of polyunsaturated fats.

Older patients with pneumonia complain of significantly fewer symptoms than do younger patients, and delirium commonly occurs. Indeed, delirium may be the only manifestation of pneumonia in this group of patients. Alcoholism, asthma, immunosuppression, and age >70 years are risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly. Among nursing home residents, the following are risk factors for pneumonia: advanced age, male sex, difficulty in swallowing, inability to take oral medications, profound disability, bedridden state, and urinary incontinence. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of pneumonia among the elderly Aspiration pneumonia is underdiagnosed in this group of patients, and tuberculosis always should be considered. In this population an etiologic diagnosis is rarely available when antimicrobial therapy must be instituted. Use of the guidelines for treatment of pneumonia issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, with modification for treatment in the nursing home setting, is recommended.

Although relatively rare, they cause significant mortality and morbidity. Glioblastoma, the most common glioma histology (similar to 45% of all gliomas), has a 5-year relative survival of similar to 5%. A small portion of these tumors are caused by Mendelian disorders, including neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Genomic analyses of glioma have also produced new evidence about risk and prognosis. Recently discovered biomarkers that indicate improved survival include O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, and a glioma cytosine-phosphate-guanine island methylator phenotype. Genome-wide association studies have identified heritable risk alleles within 7 genes that are associated with increased risk of glioma. Many risk factors have been examined as potential contributors to glioma risk. Most significantly, these include an increase in risk by exposure to ionizing radiation and a decrease in risk by history of allergies or atopic disease(s). The potential influence of occupational exposures and cellular phones has also been examined, with inconclusive results. We provide a "state of the science" review of current research into causes and risk factors for gliomas in adults.

Allergens in wheat and related cereals	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review						allergy; cereals; wheat	EXERCISE-INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS; ALPHA-AMYLASE-INHIBITOR; LIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN; CONTROLLED FOOD CHALLENGE; IGE-BINDING EPITOPE; ASPERGILLUS-DERIVED ENZYMES; BAKERS ASTHMA DISEASE; LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; MAJOR ALLERGEN; OMEGA-5 GLIADIN	Wheat is one of the major crops grown, processed and consumed by humankind and is associated with both intolerances (notably coeliac disease) and allergies. Two types of allergy are particularly well characterized. The first is bakers' asthma, which results from the inhalation of flour and dust during grain processing. Although a number of wheat proteins have been shown to bind IgE from patients with bakers' asthma, there is no doubt a well-characterized group of inhibitors of alpha-amylase (also called chloroform methanol soluble, or CM, proteins) are the major components responsible for this syndrome. The second well-characterized form of allergy to wheat proteins is wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), with the omega(5)-gliadins (part of the gluten protein fraction) being the major group of proteins which are responsible. Other forms of food allergy have also been reported, with the proteins responsible including gluten proteins, CM proteins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins. Processing of wheat and of related cereals (barley and rye, which may contain related allergens) may lead to decreased allergenicity while genetic engineering technology offers opportunities to eliminate allergens by suppressing gene expression.

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the association of obesity, as represented by a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30 kg/m(2), with quality-of-life scores, asthma control problems, and asthma-related hospitalizations. Methods: The study followed a cross-sectional design. Questionnaires were completed at home by a random sample of 1113 members of a large integrated health care organization who were 35 years of age or older with health care use suggestive of active asthma. Outcomes included the mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire, and self-reported asthma-related hospitalization. Several other factors known to influence asthma outcomes also were collected: demographics, smoking status, oral corticosteroid use in the past month, evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and inhaled corticosteroid use in the past month. Multiple logistic regression models were used to measure the association of BMI status with outcomes. Results: Even after adjusting for demographics, smoking status, oral corticosteroid use, evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and inhaled corticosteroid use, obese adults were more likely than those with normal BMIs (<25 k g/m(2)) to report poor asthma-specific quality of life (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% Cl, 1.6-4.9), poor asthma control (OR, 2.7; 95% Cl, 1.7-4.3), and a history of asthma-related hospitalizations (OR, 4.6; 95% Cl, 1.4-14.4). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that obesity is associated with worse asthma outcomes, especially an increased risk of asthma related hospitalizations.

The earth is warming, the warming is accelerating, and human actions are largely responsible. If current emissions and land use trends continue unchecked, the next generations will face more injury, disease, and death related to natural disasters and heat waves, higher rates of climate-related infections, and wide-spread malnutrition, as well as more allergic and air pollution-related morbidity and mortality. This review highlights links between global climate change and anticipated increases in prevalence and severity of asthma and related allergic disease mediated through worsening ambient air pollution and altered local and regional pollen production. The pattern of change will vary regionally depending on latitude, altitude, rainfall and storms, land-use patterns, urbanization, transportation, and energy production. The magnitude of climate change and related increases in allergic disease will be affected by how aggressively greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are pursued, but at best an average warming of I to 2 degrees C is certain this century. Thus, anticipation of a higher allergic disease burden will affect clinical practice as well as public health planning. A number of practical primary and secondary prevention strategies are suggested at the end of the review to assist in meeting this unprecedented public health challenge.

Patients who have an anaphylactic reaction have life-threatening airway and, or breathing and, or circulation problems usually associated with skin or mucosal changes. Patients having an anaphylactic reaction should be treated using the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure (ABCDE) approach. Anaphylactic reactions are not easy to study with randomised controlled trials. There are, however, systematic reviews of the available evidence and a wealth of clinical experience to help formulate guidelines. The exact treatment will depend on the patient's location, the equipment and drugs available, and the skills of those treating the anaphylactic reaction. Early treatment with intramuscular adrenaline is the treatment of choice for patients having an anaphylactic reaction. Despite previous guidelines, there is still confusion about the indications, dose and route of adrenaline. Intravenous adrenaline must only be used in certain specialist settings and only by those skilled and experienced in its use. All those who are suspected of having had an anaphylactic reaction should be referred to a specialist in allergy. Individuals who are at high risk of an anaphylactic reaction should carry an adrenaline auto-injector and receive training and support in its use. There is a need for further research about the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of anaphylactic reactions. (C) 2008 Resuscitation Council (UK). Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The NERAM Colloquium Series on Health and Air Quality was initiated to strengthen the linkage between scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders by reviewing the current state of science, identifying policy-relevant gaps and uncertainties in the scientific evidence, and proposing a path forward for research and policy to improve air quality and public health. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of science addressing the impacts of air pollution on human health. The paper is one of four background papers prepared for the 2003 NERAM/AirNet Conference on Strategies for Clean Air and Health, the third meeting in the international Colloquium Series. The review is based on the framework and findings of the U. S. National Research Committee (NRC) on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter and addresses key questions underlying air quality risk management policy decisions.

Sorokin is widely used for biocontrol of pest insects, and many commercial products are on the market or under development. The aim of this review is to summarise all relevant safety data of this fungus, which are necessary for the commercialisation and registration process. The review contains the following sections: (1) identity, (2) biological properties (history, natural occurrence and geographical distribution, host range, mode of action, production of metabolites/toxins, effect of environmental factors), (3) methods to determine and quantify residues, (4) fate and behaviour in the environment (mobility and persistence in air, water and soil), (5) effects on non-target organisms (microorganisms, plants, soil organisms, aquatic organisms, predators, parasitoids, honey bees, earth worms, etc.), (6) effects on vertebrates (fish, amphibia, reptiles, and birds), and (7) effects on mammals and human health (allergy, pathogenicity/toxicity). On the basis of the presented knowledge, M. anisopliae is considered to be safe with minimal risks to vertebrates, humans and the environment.

In this study, we show that a division of labor occurs between functionally distinct regulatory T cells (Treg) that are coordinately activated by a CD28/B-7-dependent costimulatory pathway after exposure of mice to Aspergillus conidia. Early in infection, inflammation is controlled by the expansion, activation and local recruitment of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg capable of suppressing neutrophils through the combined actions of IL-10 and CTLA-4 on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. The levels of IFN-gamma produced in this early phase set the subsequent adaptive stage by conditioning the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent tolerogenic program of dendritic cells and the subsequent activation and expansion of tolerogenic Treg, which produce IL-10 and TGF-beta, inhibit Th2 cells, and prevent allergy to the fungus. The coordinate activation of Treg may, however, be subverted by the fungus, as germinating conidia are capable of interfering with anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic Treg programs. Thus, regulation is an essential component of the host response in infection and allergy to the fungus, and its manipulation may allow the pathogen to overcome host resistance and promote disease.

Platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) concentrations have increased in the environment since the introduction of automobile catalysts. This review summarises current knowledge concerning the environmental mobility, speciation and bioavailability of Pt, Pd and Rh. The greater proportion of PGE emissions is from automobile catalysts, in the form of nanometer-sized catalyst particles, which deposit on roadside surfaces, as evidenced in samples of road dust, grass and soil. In soil, PGE can be transformed into more mobile species through complexation with organic matter and can be solubilised in low pH rainwater. There are indications that environmentally formed Pd species are more soluble and hence more mobile in the environment than Rh and Pt. PGE can reach waterbodies through stormwater transport and deposition in sediments. Besides external contamination of grass close to roads, internal PGE uptake has been observed for plants growing on soil contaminated with automobile catalyst PGE. Fine particles of PGE were also detected on the surface of feathers sampled from passerines and raptors in their natural habitat, and internal organs of these birds also contained PGE. Uptake has been observed in sediment-dwelling invertebrates, and laboratory studies have shown an uptake of PGE in eel and fish exposed to water containing road dust. The available evidence indicates that the PGE, especially Pd, are transported to biological materials through deposition in roots by binding to sulphur-rich low molecular weight species in plants. PGE uptake to exposed animals have uptake rates in the following order: Pd>Pt>Rh. The liver and kidney accumulate the highest levels of PGE, especially Pd. Urinary Pd and Rh, but not Pt, levels are correlated with traffic intensity. Dental alloys may lead to elevated urinary Pt levels. Platinum is a well-known allergen and Pd also shows a strong sensitisation potential. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The data were collected within the Traffic-Related Air Pollution on Childhood Asthma (TRAPCA) study in Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden. The study was designed to assess the health impact of spatial contrasts in long-term average concentrations. The measurement sites were distributed between background and traffic locations. Annual EC and PM2.5 absorbance measurements were at traffic sites on average 43-84% and 26-76% higher, respectively, compared to urban background sites. The contrast for PM2.5 mass measurements was lower (8-35%). The smaller contrast observed for PM2.5 mass in comparison with PM2.5 absorbance and EC documents that PM2.5 mass underestimates exposure contrasts related to motorized traffic emissions. The correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 was high, documenting that most of the spatial variation of PM10 was because of PM2.5. The measurement of PM2.5 absorbance was highly correlated with EC measurements and suggests that absorbance can be used as a simple, inexpensive and non-destructive method. to estimate motorized traffic-related particulate air pollution. The EC/absorbance relation differed between countries and site type (background/traffic), supporting the need for site-specific calibrations of the simple absorbance method. While the ratio between PM2.5 and PM10 mass ranged from 0.54 to 0.68, the ratio of PM2.5 absorbance and PM10 absorbance was 0.96-0.97, indicating that PM2.5 absorbance captures nearly all of the particle absorbance.

Metalloproteinases are thought to play a role in these structural changes. Methods: We studied the gelatinolytic activity present in the induced sputum from 20 patients with asthma, 20 with COPD and 19 healthy controls. The assessment of gelatinolytic activity was performed by quantitative zymography, and gelatinolytic species were identified by Western blot analysis. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-l (TIMP-1) was detected by reverse zymography and ELISA. Results: From zymography, we found significantly higher gelatinolytic activity linked to pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) in the sputum from asthmatics (p < 0.0001) and COPD patients (p < 0.0001) compared to the control group. Furthermore, the activated form of MMP-9 (85 kD) was found in the sputum from 60% of asthmatics and 85% of COPD patients, but was absent in that of control subjects (p < 0.0001). Importantly, although less frequently detectable than pro-MMP-9, pro-MMP-2 (72 kD) was found more frequently in asthmatics (50%) than in control subjects (5%) (p < 0.005). We also described two unusual gelatinolytic species of 45 and 120 kD and showed that they derived from MMP-9 according to their ability to bind gelatin and anti-MMP-9 antibody. Levels of TIMP-1 were higher in asthmatics (p < 0.05) and COPD patients (p < 0.05) than in controls.

Members of the Danish Contact Dermatitis Group collected patch-test results from consecutive eczema patients as well as information about exposures and demographic variables over a 6-month period in 1985-86. The investigation was repeated in 1997-98 in the same clinics, at the same time of year, using identical methods and patch-test substances, including nickel sulphate 5%, potassium dichromate 0.5% and fragrance mix 8%. Nickel was the most common contact allergen in both study periods, followed by the fragrance mix. In children 0-18 years of age, the frequency of nickel allergy decreased from 24.8% in the first study period to 9.2% in the second study period (P < 0.0008), Fragrance mix allergy doubled in frequency from 4.1% in 1985-86 to 9.9% in 1997-98, an increase that affected all age groups. Contact allergy to potassium dichromate decreased significantly from 3.0% in the first period to 1.2% in the second period (P = 0.001). The decrease was seen in both sexes and was most pronounced among those of working age, No other significant changes were found in the frequency of sensitization to common allergens over the 12-year observation period.

Despite advances in asthma management, acute exacerbations continue to occur and impose considerable morbidity on patients and constitute a major burden on health care resources. Respiratory tract viruses have emerged as the most frequent triggers for exacerbations in both children and adults; however, the mechanisms underlying these remain poorly understood. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that interactions might exist between viruses and other triggers, increasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. In this article we begin with an overview of the health, economic, and social burden that exacerbations of asthma carry with them. This is followed by a review of the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations, highlighting the various triggers responsible and multiple interactions that exist between them. The final section first addresses what preventative measures are currently available for asthma exacerbations and subsequently examines which of the new treatments in development might lessen the burden of exacerbations in the future.

These models have highlighted the importance of T-helper type 2 driven allergic responses in the progression of asthma and have been useful in the identification of potential drug targets for interventions involving allergic pathways. However, a number of drugs that have been shown to have some efficacy in animal models of asthma have shown little clinical benefit in human asthmatics. This may be due to a number of factors including the species of animal chosen and the methods used to induce an asthmatic phenotype in animals that do not normally develop a disease that could be characterized as asthma. The range of animal models available is vast, with the most popular models being rodents (inbred mice and rats) and guinea-pigs, which have the benefit of being easy to handle and being relatively cost effective compared with other models that are available. The recent advances in transgenic technology and the development of species-specific probes, particularly in mice, have allowed detailed mechanistic studies to be conducted. Despite these advances in technology, there are a number of issues with current animal models of asthma that must be recognized including the disparity in immunology and anatomy between these species and humans, the requirement for adjuvant during senitization in most models, the acute nature of the allergic response that is induced and the use of adult animals as the primary disease model. Some larger animal models using sheep and dogs have been developed that may address some of these issues but they also have different biology from humans in many ways and are extremely costly, with very few probes available for characterizing allergic responses in the airway in these species. As research in this area continues to expand, the relative merits and limitations of each model must be defined and understood in order to evaluate the information that is obtained from these models and to extrapolate these findings to humans so that effective drug therapies can be developed. Despite these issues, animal models have been, and will continue to be, vital in understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the development and progression of asthma.

Evaluation of asthma with hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI - Correlation with clinical severity and spirometry	CHEST			English	Article						airflow obstruction; airway; asthma; bronchial activity; hyperpolarized gases; hyperpolarized helium-3; MRI; pulmonary function test; spirometry; ventilation defect	LUNG-TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS; PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; SMALL AIRWAYS; AIR SPACES; GAS; ABNORMALITIES; VENTILATION; VOLUMES	Background: Accurate characterization of asthma severity is difficult due to the variability of symptoms. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI ((HHeMR)-He-3) is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective of this study was to compare the extent of (HHeMR)-He-3 ventilation defects with measures of asthma severity and spirometry. Methods: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects underwent (HHeMR)-He-3. For each person, the number and size of ventilation defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined. Results: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n = 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent, n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs; 0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated significantly with FEV1/FVC (r = -0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% from the beginning of FVC (FEF25-75%) percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (%predicted) [r = -0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV1 %predicted (r = -0.40, p = 0.002), but not with FVC %predicted (r = -0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory flow %predicted (r = -0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF25%-75%, were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistant asthma, there were more defects >= 3 cm than in the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021). Conclusions: Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by (HHeMR)-He-3 correlate with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.

Parental report of health conditions and health care use among children with and without autism - National Survey of Children's Health	ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS & ADOLESCENT MEDICINE			English	Article							SPECTRUM DISORDERS; GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS; MEDICAL CONDITIONS; PREVALENCE TRENDS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; ABNORMALITIES; EPILEPSY; DISABILITIES; INDIVIDUALS	Objective: To compare parent-reported prevalence of health conditions and health care use between children with and without autism. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2003 to 2004 National Survey of Children's Health. Setting: Population-based sample across the United States. Participants: More than 100 000 parents. The main exposure was "autism" (not further defined), from response to the question: "Has a doctor or health professional ever told you that your child has autism?" Main Outcome Measures: Medical and mental health conditions and measures of health care use. Results: Autism prevalence among children aged 3 to 17 years was 53 per 10 000 (95% confidence interval, 45-61 per 10 000), equating to a national estimate of 324 000 children (95% confidence interval, 274 000-375 000 children). Children with autism had a significantly (P <.001) higher prevalence of depression or anxiety problems (38.9% vs 4.2%) and behavioral or conduct problems (58.9% vs 5.2%) than children without autism. Respiratory, food, and skin allergies were reported by parents more often for children with autism, with food allergies having the strongest relative difference between the groups (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-7.0). Children with autism had significantly (P <.001) higher mean physician visits over 12 months for preventive care, nonemergency care, and hospital emergency care, and were far more likely than children without autism to receive physical, occupational, or speech therapy (76.0% vs 6.3%), to need treatment or counseling for an emotional, developmental, or behavioral problem (75.4% vs 7.0%), and, among those taking a prescribed medication, to be using a medication long-term (51.4% vs 14.5%). Conclusion: We found markedly higher reports of concurrent conditions and health care use associated with childhood autism in this study.

It is a direct thrombin inhibitor obtained by recombinant technology from the medicinal leech and is approved for treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated by thrombosis. Because 3 cases of fatal anaphylaxis possibly associated with use of lepirudin have been reported, we initiated an investigation of putative lepirudin-associated anaphylaxis. Methods and Results - Aided by the manufacturer (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), we used the lepirudin study databases to identify all patients in whom possible anaphylaxis/severe allergy was recorded from 1994 to September 2002. The 26 possible cases identified were reviewed independently by 2 investigators. After excluding patients with mild skin reactions, reactions likely caused by concomitant medications, poorly documented cases, and reactions that did not correspond temporally with lepirudin use, there remained 9 patients judged to have had severe anaphylaxis in close temporal association with lepirudin. All reactions occurred within minutes of intravenous lepirudin administration, with 4 fatal outcomes (3 acute cardiorespiratory arrests, 1 hypotension-induced myocardial infarction). In these 4 cases, a previous uneventful treatment course with lepirudin was identified (1 to 12 weeks earlier). We recorded high-titer IgG-anti-lepirudin antibodies in an additional patient with anaphylaxis. Because lepirudin has been used in approximate to35 000 patients, the risk of anaphylaxis is approximate to0.015% (5 of 32 500) on first exposure and 0.16% (4 of 2500) in reexposed patients (7.5% estimated reexposures). Conclusion - Lepirudin can cause fatal anaphylaxis, particularly in patients who are treated within 3 months of a previous exposure.

Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) has generally been considered to have no systemic activity at recommended doses, but the potential for long-term effects on growth has not previously been evaluated. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of 1 year of treatment with intranasal BDP on growth in children. Study Design. In this double-blind, randomized, parallel- group study, 100 prepubertal children 6 to 9 years old with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with aqueous BDP 168 mu g twice daily (n = 51) or placebo (n = 49) for 1 year. Subjects' baseline heights were required to be between the 5th and 95th percentile, and skeletal age as determined by left wrist radiograph was required to be within 2 years of chronological age. Washout periods for medications known to affect growth, including other forms of corticosteroids, were established, and these medications were prohibited during the study. However, short courses of oral prednisolone lasting no more than 7 days, and short courses of dermatologic corticosteroids lasting no more than 10 days, were allowed. Height was measured with a stadiometer after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months of treatment. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis was assessed by measurements of 8 AM basal cortisol concentrations and response to .25 mg cosyntropin stimulation. The primary safety parameter was the rate of change in standing height. Statistical analyses were based on all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of medication (intent-to-treat principle). The rate of change in standing height was analyzed for all subjects who entered the study and for those completing the full 12 months of treatment (n = 80). The rate of change in standing height over the 1-year study was calculated as the slope of a linear regression line fitted to each subject's height measurements over time. Because there was a statistically significant between-group difference in standing height at baseline, an analysis of covariance was performed for all analyses of standing height data. Results. Of the 100 subjects enrolled, 90 completed the study. The 2 treatment groups were generally comparable at baseline; however, at baseline, mean age and mean height were significantly greater in the BDP treatment group that the in placebo treatment group. In both analyses, overall growth rate was significantly slower in BDP-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects. The mean change in standing height after 1 year was 5.0 cm in the BDP-treated subjects compared with 5.9 cm in the placebo-treated subjects. The difference in growth rates was evident as early as the 1-month treatment visit, suggesting that the effect on growth occurred initially. The growth-suppressive effect of BDP remained consistent across all age and gender subgroups, and among subjects with and without a previous history of corticosteroid use. Use of additional exogenous corticosteroids during the study was similar in both groups and did not affect the results. Because there was a baseline imbalance in height, a supplemental analysis of the differences in prestudy growth rates was performed. This analysis found no baseline imbalance in prestudy growth rates. To determine whether the difference in growth rates during the study could be attributed to preexisting growth rates, a z score analysis was performed. The heights of both groups were normalized at baseline and at the end of the study using the US National Center for Health Statistics data for mean and standard deviations of height. This analysis confirmed that the difference in growth rates between the 2 groups was primarily attributable to the treatment rather than to any preexisting difference in growth. Additional analyses confirmed that the results were not influenced by outlier values. No significant between-group difference were found in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis assessments. No unusual adverse events were observed. No evidence of other systemic effects of BDP was found, including analysis for fluid and electrolyte imbalances; alterations in protein, lipid, or carbohydrate metabolism; alterations in formed elements in blood; and alterations in differential white blood cell counts, including eosinophils. Conclusions. Additional study is warranted to define the clinical relevance of these findings. This study suggests, however, that intranasal BDP may slow growth rate in children without suppressing basal 6 AM cortisol concentrations or the response to cosyntropin stimulation, which are commonly used clinically to test for adrenal suppression. The effect on final height is unknown. Alterative explantations for the finding of drug-induced growth suppression, including the possibility that the results were affected by either differences in height and age at baseline between the 2 groups or by outlier values, were discounted upon additional analysis. The results of this study were considered by the Food and Drug Administration in the development of recently proposed new class labeling for all inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids, which states that these agents may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (see reference 21). However, both the Food and Drug Administration and several professional bodies in the United States concur that, depending on disease severity, the benefits of intranasal corticosteroid therapy may outweigh the risks (see reference 22). Because the effect, if any, on final height in not known, the height of children receiving long-term therapy should be monitored periodically during treatment, and should be plotted on a growth or growth-velocity chart to monitor for growth suppression. To minimize the risks of systemic corticosteroid exposure, including growth suppresson, dose-reduction strategies should be considered. For patients who concomitantly receive exogenous corticosteroids via other routes for other conditions, such as inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, clinicians should consider the total corticosteroid exposure and titrate each patient to the lowest effective dose. Clinicians should also consider each medication's potential for systemic effects when selecting among the various available corticosteroids.

Natl Heart Lung Blood Inst Severe	Lung function in adults with stable but severe asthma: air trapping and incomplete reversal of obstruction with bronchodilation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						airway closure; difficult asthma; fixed obstruction	CHRONIC PERSISTENT ASTHMA; ELASTIC RECOIL; NOCTURNAL ASTHMA; FLOW OBSTRUCTION; RESEARCH-PROGRAM; REFERENCE VALUES; RESIDUAL VOLUME; EXPIRATORY FLOW; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; DISTAL LUNG	Five to ten percent of asthma cases are poorly controlled chronically and refractory to treatment, and these severe cases account for disproportionate asthma-associated morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization. While persons with severe asthma tend to have more airway obstruction, it is not known whether they represent the severe tail of a unimodal asthma population, or a severe asthma phenotype. We hypothesized that severe asthma has a characteristic physiology of airway obstruction, and we evaluated spirometry, lung volumes, and reversibility during a stable interval in 287 severe and 382 nonsevere asthma subjects from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program. We partitioned airway obstruction into components of air trapping [indicated by forced vital capacity (FVC)] and airflow limitation [indicated by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/FVC]. Severe asthma had prominent air trapping, evident as reduced FVC over the entire range of FEV1/FVC. This pattern was confirmed with measures of residual lung volume/total lung capacity (TLC) in a subgroup. In contrast, nonsevere asthma did not exhibit prominent air trapping, even at FEV1/FVC <75% predicted. Air trapping also was associated with increases in TLC and functional reserve capacity. After maximal bronchodilation, FEV1 reversed similarly from baseline in severe and nonsevere asthma, but the severe asthma classification was an independent predictor of residual reduction in FEV1 after maximal bronchodilation. An increase in FVC accounted for most of the reversal of FEV1 when baseline FEV1 was <60% predicted. We conclude that air trapping is a characteristic feature of the severe asthma population, suggesting that there is a pathological process associated with severe asthma that makes airways more vulnerable to this component.

Regional differences in EpiPen prescriptions in the United States: The potential role of vitamin D	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						anaphylaxis; epidemiology; EpiPen; vitamin D	REGULATORY T-CELLS; SUN EXPOSURE; ANAPHYLAXIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; ALLERGY; MELANOMA; CHILDREN; RISK; D-3	Background: The epidemiology of anaphylaxis is uncertain, especially its geographic distribution. Objective: To address this deficit, we examined regional rates of EpiPen prescriptions in the United States. Methods: EpiPen prescriptions in 2004 were obtained for all 50 states and Washington, DC, from NDCHealth, Pharmaceutical Audit Suite (Alpharetta, Ga). Data included the number of total filled prescriptions, including refills, and the actual number of EpiPens prescribed. Several data sets were used to obtain state-specific populations, as well as multiple demographic, health, and weather characteristics. State population was used to calculate the average number of prescriptions written per person. Results: Overall, there were 1,511,534 EpiPen prescriptions filled during 2004. These prescriptions accounted for 2,495,188 EpiPens. On average, there were 5.71 EpiPens prescribed per 1000 persons. Massachusetts had the highest number of prescriptions per 1000 persons (11.8), whereas Hawaii had the lowest (2.7). In addition to state-to-state variation, there was an obvious regional difference: New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine) had the highest values, with 8 to 12 EpiPen prescriptions per 1000 persons, whereas the southern states (between and including California and Mississippi) had only 3 prescriptions per 1000 persons. The New England finding persisted even when controlling for all available factors (eg, population demographic characteristics, number of health care providers, prescriptions for other medications). Conclusion: A strong north-south gradient was observed for the prescription of EpiPens in the United States, with the highest rates found in New England. Clinical implications: The regional differences in EpiPen prescribing may provide important etiologic clues (vitamin D status) and merit further investigation.

Increased risk of childhood asthma from antibiotic use in early life	CHEST			English	Article						antibacterial agents; asthma; child; infant	INTESTINAL MICROFLORA; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; 1ST YEAR; ALLERGIC DISEASE; ORAL ANTIBIOTICS; SWEDISH INFANTS; BIRTH COHORT; SCHOOL-AGE; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE	Background: To address the major methodological issues of reverse causation and selection bias in epidemiologic studies of antibiotic use in early life and the development of asthma, we undertook a cohort study of this association in a complete population of children. Methods: Using the health-care and prescription databases of Manitoba, Canada, this longitudinal study assessed the association between antibiotic prescription use during the first year of life and asthma at age 7 years in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,116 children. Results: Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, asthma was significantly more likely to develop in children who had received antibiotics in the first year of life at age 7 years. The association with asthma was observed for antibiotic use in non-respiratory tract infections (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 3.37). The risk of asthma was highest in children receiving more than four courses of antibiotics (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.88), especially among rural children, and in the absence of maternal asthma or a dog in the birth year. Broad-spectrum (BS) cephalosporin use was more common in these sub-populations of children. Conclusions: Antibiotic use in early life was associated with the development of childhood asthma, a risk that may be reduced by avoiding the use of BS cephalosporins.

This hypothesis has evolved in various ways exploring the role of overt viral and bacterial infections, the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds, and their effect on underlying responses of innate and adaptive immunity. So far a truly unifying concept is still lacking, but various pieces of a complex interplay between a host's immune response, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure, and the interactions between a genetic background and a range of exposures become apparent. All these pieces eventually assemble to the clinical presentation of a complex syndrome namely of asthma and allergic illnesses. Even if today practical implications cannot directly be deduced from these findings, there is great potential for the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in the future based on the concepts of the 'hygiene hypothesis'.

Results from a study of adult Norwegian farmers	THORAX			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; DANISH FARMERS; HAY-FEVER; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE; CHRONIC-BRONCHITIS; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; ENDOTOXIN; DUST	Background: A protective effect of endotoxin exposure on atopy and asthma in farmers' children has been postulated. Studies of adult farmers have shown conflicting results but often lack exposure data. The prevalence of asthma in farmers with different exposure levels to microbial agents and irritant gases was compared. Methods: Atopy was defined as a positive response to multiple radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) with a panel of 10 common respiratory allergens, and asthma was ascertained by a questionnaire using a stratified sample (n = 2169) of a farming population from south-eastern Norway. Exposure of farmers to total dust, fungal spores, bacteria, endotoxins, and ammonia was assessed by exposure measurements. Results: The prevalence of asthma was 3.7% for physician diagnosed asthma and 2.7% for current asthma. The prevalence of atopy was 14%, but most asthmatic subjects were non-atopic (80%). Compared with farmers without livestock, ( 1) asthma was significantly higher in cattle farmers (ORadj 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8) and pig farmers (ORadj 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5), (2) non-atopic asthma was significantly higher in pig farmers (ORadj 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) and in farmers with two or more types of livestock (ORadj 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.3), and ( 3) atopic asthma was less common in farmers with two or more types of livestock (ORadj 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97). Exposure to endotoxins, fungal spores, and ammonia was positively associated with non-atopic asthma and negatively associated with atopic asthma. No associations were found with atopy. Conclusions: Exposure to endotoxins and fungal spores appears to have a protective effect on atopic asthma but may induce non-atopic asthma in farmers.

Various histopathologic patterns of bronchiolar injury have been described and have led to confusing nomenclature with redundant and overlapping terms. Some histopathologic patterns of bronchiolar disease may be relatively unique to a specific clinical context but others are nonspecific with respect to either etiology or pathogenesis. Herein, we present a scheme separating (1) those disorders in which the bronchiolar disease is the predominant abnormality (primary bronchiolar disorders) from (2) parenchymal disorders with prominent bronchiolar involvement and (3) bronchiolar involvement in large airway diseases. Primary bronchiolar disorders include constrictive bronchiolitis (obliterative bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans), acute bronchiolitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, mineral dust airway disease, follicular bronchiolitis, and a few other rare variants. Prominent bronchiolar involvement may be seen in several interstitial lung diseases, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia), and pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Large airway diseases that commonly involve bronchioles include bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The clinical relevance of a bronchiolar lesion is best determined by identifying the underlying histopathologic pattern and assessing the correlative clinico-physiologic-radiologic context.

A total of 31 two-sided Ogawa(TM) passive samplers (using triethanolamine-impregnated filters as an absorbent) were installed for 7 days in groups of two or three along an axis perpendicular to a major highway where traffic density exceeds 100 000 vehicles/day. Distances ranged from 0 to 1310 m from the highway. Concentrations of NO2 ranged from 11.9 to 29.3 ppb, and decreased significantly with increasing logarithmic distance from the highway (P < 0.0001). Concentrations of NO2 were also significantly lower upwind than downwind relative to the highway (P= 0.0012). These findings indicate that distance from highways may be a valid surrogate for traffic-related air pollution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We conducted a study to assess the risk of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution for the development of inhalant allergy and asthma in children in Stockholm county, Munich and the Netherlands. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed through a 1-year monitoring program and regression modeling using exposure indicators. This paper documents the performance of the exposure monitoring strategy and the spatial variation of ambient particle concentrations. We measured the ambient concentration of PM2.5 and the reflectance of PM2.5 filters ('soot') at 40-42 sites representative of different exposure conditions of the three study populations. Each site was measured during four 14-day average sampling periods spread over one year (spring 1999 to summer 2000). In each study area, a continuous measurement site was operated to remove potential bias due to temporal variation. The selected approach was an efficient method to characterize spatial differences in annual average concentration between a large number of sites in each study area. Adjustment with data from the continuous measurement site improved the precision of the calculated annual averages, especially for PM2.5. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 11 to 20 mug/m(3) in Munich, from 8 to 16 mug/m(3) in Stockholm and from 14 to 26 mug/m(3) in the Netherlands. Larger spatial contrasts were found for the absorption coefficient of PM2.5. PM2.5 concentrations were on average 17-18% higher at traffic sites than at urban background sites, but PM2.5 absorption coefficients at traffic sites were between 31% and 55% increased above background. This suggests that spatial variation of traffic-related air pollution may be underestimated if PM2.5 only is measured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition to the well-studied critera air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone, diesel exhaust and diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) also appear to play a role in respiratory and allergic diseases. Diesel exhaust is composed of vapors, gases, and fine particles emitted by diesel-fueled compression-ignition engines. DEPs can act as nonspecific airway irritants at relatively high levels. At lower levels, DEPs promote release of specific cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, and oxidants in the upper and lower airway. Release of these mediators of the allergic and inflammatory response initiates a cascade that can culminate in airway inflammation, mucus secretion, serum leakage into the air-ways, and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. DEPs also may promote expression of the T(H)2 immunologic response phenotype that has been associated with asthma and allergic disease. DEPs appear to have greater immunologic effects in the presence of environmental allergens than they do a-lone. This immunologic evidence may help explain the epidemiologic studies indicating that children living along major trucking thoroughfares are at increased risk for asthmatic and allergic symptoms and a-re more likely to have objective evidence of respiratory dysfunction.

In patients who don't respond adequately to anti-allergic drugs. Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy is effective although requires specialist administration. Sublingual immunotherapy may represent an effective and safer alternative. This Cochrane systematic review is an update of one published in 2003. We searched Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, Central, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Biosis Previews, Cambridge Scientific Abstarcts, mRCT and additional sources. We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials of sublingual immunotherapy in adults and children. Two authors selected studies and assessed them for quality. Data were put into RevMan 5.0 for a statistical analysis. We used standardised mean difference (SMD), with a random effect model to combine data. Sixty studies were included, with 49 suitable for meta-analysis. We found significant reductions in symptoms (SMD -0.49; 95%CI (-0.64 to -0.34, P < 0.00001)) and medication requirements (SMD -0.32; 95%CI (-0.43 to -0.21, P < 0.00001)) compared with placebo. None of the trials reported severe systemic reactions, anaphylaxis or use of Adrenaline. This updated review reinforces the conclusion of the original 2003 Cochrane Review that sublingual immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinitis and appears a safe route of administration.

At low concentrations, airborne LPS can induce a lung DC-driven Th2 cell response to harmless inhaled antigens, thereby promoting allergic asthma. However, only a small fraction of people exposed to environmental LIPS develop allergic asthma. What prevents most people from mounting a lung DC-driven Th2 response upon exposure to LPS is not understood. Here we have shown that lung interstitial macrophages (IMs), a cell population with no previously described in vivo function, prevent induction of a Th2 response in mice challenged with LPS and an experimental harmless airborne antigen. IMs, but not alveolar macrophages, were found to produce high levels of IL-10 and to inhibit LPS-induced maturation and migration of DCs loaded with the experimental harmless airborne antigen in an IL-10-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that specific in vivo elimination of IMs led to overt asthmatic reactions to innocuous airborne antigens inhaled with low doses of LPS. This study has revealed a crucial role for IMs in maintaining immune homeostasis in the respiratory tract and provides an explanation for the paradox that although airborne LPS has the ability to promote the induction of Th2 responses by lung DCs, it does not provoke airway allergy under normal conditions.

The aim of this prospective study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of skin tests in patients who have experienced such reactions. Skin prick, intradermal and patch tests with a series of contrast media were conducted in 220 patients with either immediate or nonimmediate reaction. Positive skin tests were defined according to internationally accepted guidelines. Seventy-one never-exposed subjects and 11 subjects who had tolerated contrast medium exposure, served as negative controls. Skin test specificity was 96-100%. For tests conducted within the time period from 2 to 6 months after the reaction, up to 50% of immediate reactors and up to 47% of nonimmediate reactors were skin test positive. For immediate reactors, the intradermal tests were the most sensitive, whereas delayed intradermal tests in combination with patch tests were needed for optimal sensitivity in nonimmediate reactors. Contrast medium cross-reactivity was more common in the nonimmediate than in the immediate group. Interestingly, 49% of immediate and 52% of nonimmediate symptoms occurred in previously unexposed patients. Many of these patients were skin test positive, indicating that they were already sensitized at the time of first contrast medium exposure. These data suggest that at least 50% of hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media are caused by an immunological mechanism. Skin testing appears to be a useful tool for diagnosis of contrast medium allergy and may play an important role in selection of a safe product in previous reactors.

However, the precise mechanisms that drive AHR remain unclear. We identified a novel subset of natural killer T (NKT) cells that expresses the interleukin 17 receptor B (IL-17RB) for IL-25 (also known as IL-17E) and is essential for the induction of AHR. IL-17RB is preferentially expressed on a fraction of CD4(+) NKT cells but not on other splenic leukocyte populations tested. IL-17RB(+) CD4(+) NKT cells produce predominantly IL-13 and Th2 chemokines upon stimulation with IL-25 in vitro. IL-17RB(+) NKT cells were detected in the lung, and depletion of IL-17RB(+) NKT cells by IL-17RB(-)specific monoclonal antibodies or NKT cell deficient J alpha 18(-/-) mice failed to develop IL-25-dependent AHR. Cell transfer of IL-17RB(+) but not IL-17RB(-) NKT cells into J alpha 18(-/-) mice also successfully reconstituted AHR induction. These results strongly suggest that IL-17RB(+) CD4(+) NKT cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of asthma.

More that half of the body's intake during a lifetime is air inhaled in the home. Thus, most illnesses related to environmental exposures stem from indoor air exposure. Indoor air was believed to be a major environmental factor for more than a hundred years, from the start of the hygienic revolution, around 1850, until outdoor environmental issues entered the scene, and became dominant around 1960. Main environmental issues today are outdoor air quality, energy use, and sustainable buildings, but not indoor air quality (IAQ). But, there is mounting evidence that exposure to IAQ is the cause of excessive morbidity and mortality. In developing regions indoor unvented burning of biomass for cooking is the cause of at least 2,000,000 deaths a year (mainly women and children), and in the developed world IAQ is a main cause of allergies, other hypersensitivity reactions, airway infections, and cancers. Cancer of the lungs is related to indoor radon and ETS exposure. Allergies, airway infections and sick building syndrome are associated with, e.g., "dampness", a low ventilation rate, and plasticizers. In the future more emphasis must be given to IAQ and health issues.

Airway wall remodeling can contribute to airway narrowing as well as to the airway hyperresponsiveness, which is a characteristic abnormality in asthma. However, the potential for airway narrowing could be much worse if it were not for some of the protective effects of remodeling that may help to limit airway narrowing in asthmatic patients. This minireview discusses the evidence for airway wall remodeling and its effects, friend and/or foe, on airway narrowing in asthmatic patients.

The U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) is participating in an international research effort to improve this understanding by the development of the International Tissue and Tumor Repository for Chronic Arsenosis (ITTRCA). The ITTRCA obtains, archives, and makes available for research purposes, tissues from subjects exposed to arsenic. We provide here a short overview of arsenic-induced pathology, briefly describe arsenic-induced lesions in the skin and liver, and present five case reports from the ITTRCA. Arsenic-induced skin pathology includes hyperkeratosis, pigmentation changes, Bowen disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinomas. A unique spectrum of skin lesions, known as arsenical keratosis, is rather characteristic of chronic arseniasis. Bowen disease, or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the skin, has been well documented as a consequence of arsenical exposure. A spectrum of liver lesions has also been attributed to chronic arseniasis. Of these, hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, cirrhosis, and hepatoportal sclerosis have been associated with arsenic exposure. We present case reports that relate to these health conditions, namely, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and Bowen disease of the skin and hepatocellular carcinoma and angiosarcoma of the liver. Four patients had been treated with arsenical medications for such conditions as asthma, psoriasis, and syphilis, and one case occurred in a boy chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water.

This notification will be required seven days before the event and must be accompanied by objective evidence that justifies the need to use one. The IOC-MC has expressed the viewpoint that, at present, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea (EVH) is the optimal laboratory challenge to confirm that an athlete has exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The EVH test recommended was specifically designed to identify EIB. EVH has been performed in thousands of subjects in both the laboratory and the field. The test requires the subject to hyperventilate dry air containing 5% carbon dioxide at room temperature for six minutes at a target ventilation of 30 times the subject's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The test conditions can be modified to simulate the conditions that give the athlete their symptoms with exercise. A reduction in FEV1 of 10% or more of the value before the test is considered positive.

In Finland, individuals with clinically well-established persistent asthma are registered for reimbursement of medication from the national health insurance scheme. We combined, at an individual level, these data with the population census data of 1985, 1990, and 1995 to estimate the attributable fraction of work in adult-onset persistent asthma. Our follow-up study covered the entire 25- to 59-yr-old employed population of Finland in 1986-1998. Relative risks (RR) for occupational categories were estimated in comparison to those employed in administrative work. There were 49,575 incident cases of asthma. The attributable fraction of occupation was 29% (95% CI 25-33%) for men and 17% (95% CI 15-19%) for women. The risk was increased especially in agricultural work, manufacturing work, and service work. In addition to already established risk occupations of occupational asthma, such as food and beverage work, the analysis identified a large number of occupations with significant excess of asthma incidence. The results indicate that the impact of occupational factors in the inception of adult-onset persistent asthma, and consequently the potential for prevention, is much larger and more widely spread than generally assumed.

Exposure to various environmental factors, including air pollutants and allergens, has been suggested as a partial explanation of these trends. To examine relations between several air pollutants and asthma exacerbation in African Americans, we recruited a panel of 138 children in central Los Angeles. We recorded daily data on respiratory symptoms and medication use for 13 weeks and examined these data in conjunction with data on ozone (O-3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), meteorological variables, pollens, and molds. Using generalized estimating equations, we found associations between respiratory symptom occurrence and several environmental factors. For example, new episodes of cough were associated with exposure to PM10 (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.39; interquartile range [IQR] = 17 mug/m(3), 24-hour average), PM2.5 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03-1.18; IQR = 30 mug/m(3), 12-hour average), NO2, and the molds Cladosporium and Alternaria, but not with exposure to O-3 or pollen. The factors PM10 and O-3 were associated with the use of extra asthma medication. For this population several bioaerosols and air pollutants had effects that may be clinically significant.

Reducing exposure may offer a realistic chance for primary prevention of sensitization and asthma, but it is essential to implement measures that can achieve and maintain the low-allergen environment. Objective: Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of mite allergen avoidance measures in achieving and maintaining a low-allergen environment during pregnancy and in the first year of life. Methods: The Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study is a prospective, prenatally randomized study that follows the development of asthma and atopy in a cohort of infants at high risk (both parents atopic) who are randomly allocated to full mite allergen avoidance or to a normal regimen. Avoidance measures comprise (1) mite-proof covers (mattress, pillow, and quilt) for parental bed, (2) high-filtration vacuum cleaner, (3) vinyl flooring in infant's bedroom, (4) new crib and portable crib mattresses encased in mite-proof material, (5) benzyl benzoate (Acarosan) applied on carpets and soft furniture, (6) bed linens washed in hot water weekly, and (7) washable soft toys. Dust samples from the parental bed, bedroom floor, living room floor, infant's mattress, and nursery floor were collected between the 10th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, immediately after birth, and then at age 6 months and 1 year, and Der p 1 levels were determined by mAb-based ELISA. Results: Recovered Der p 1 from maternal mattress was reduced by 97.25% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.25%-98.41%) during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with the effect persisting for 6 months (98% reduction, 95% CI 97.258-99.1%) and 12 months (97.6% reduction, 95% CI 95.7%-98.6%) after the birth (active vs control, P <.000001). Total Der p 1 from bedroom floor in the active group was reduced by 53.7% (95 % CI 25.7%-71.2%) in samples collected within 4 weeks of the child's birth, with the percentage reduction being 62.8% (95 % CI 39.3%-77.2%) at 6 months and 26.5% (95% CI-24% to 57.1%) at 1 year (active compared vs control, P <.007). Der p 1 levels in crib mattress and nursery floor in the active group were extremely low (crib mattresses geometric mean [95% CI] 2.3 ng [1.6-3.4] at birth, 6.8 ng [4.5-10] at age 6 months, and 15.6 ng [9.8-24.8] at age 1 year [active vs control, P =.001]; nursery 1 ng [0.9-1.1] at birth, 1.7 ng [1.2-2.5] at age 6 months, and 2 ng [1.3-3.5] at age 1 year [active vs control, P <.00001]). The total amount of allergen recovered at age 1 year was 29-fold (95% CI 15.1- to 56.7-fold) higher in the control group than in the active group. Conclusions: The avoidance measures used in this study achieved and maintained a low mite allergen environment during pregnancy and in the first year of life in homes of infants at risk of atopy.

Unbiased Biomarkers Prediction	Diagnosis and definition of severe refractory asthma: an international consensus statement from the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI)	THORAX			English	Review							TO-TREAT ASTHMA; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; AIR-FLOW LIMITATION; LUNG-FUNCTION; SPUTUM EOSINOPHILIA; RESEARCH-PROGRAM; CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA	Patients with severe refractory asthma pose a major healthcare problem. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that, for the development of new targeted therapies, there is an urgent need for further characterisation and classification of these patients. The Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) consortium is a pan-European public-private collaboration funded by the European Commission Innovative Medicines Initiative of the European Union. U-BIOPRED aims to subphenotype patients with severe refractory asthma by using an innovative systems biology approach. This paper presents the U-BIOPRED international consensus on the definition and diagnosis of severe asthma, aligning the latest concepts in adults as well as in children. The consensus is based on existing recommendations up to 2010 and will be used for the selection of patients for the upcoming U-BIOPRED study. It includes the differentiation between 'problematic', 'difficult' and 'severe refractory' asthma, and provides a systematic algorithmic approach to the evaluation of patients presenting with chronic severe asthma symptoms for use in clinical research and specialised care.

Long-term impact of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence on morbidity and premature mortality in adulthood: systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Review						overweight; child; BMI; morbidity	BODY-MASS INDEX; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; FOLLOW-UP; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BREAST-CANCER; LIFE-COURSE; MIDDLE-AGE; SUBSEQUENT MORTALITY	Background and objective: The last systematic review on the health consequences of child and adolescent obesity found little evidence on consequences for adult health. The present study aimed to summarize evidence on the long-term impact of child and adolescent obesity for premature mortality and physical morbidity in adulthood. Methods: Systematic review with evidence searched from January 2002 to June 2010. Studies were included if they contained a measure of overweight and/or obesity between birth and 18 years (exposure measure) and premature mortality and physical morbidity (outcome) in adulthood. Results: Five eligible studies examined associations between overweight and/or obesity, and premature mortality: 4/5 found significantly increased risk of premature mortality with child and adolescent overweight or obesity. All 11 studies with cardiometabolic morbidity as outcomes reported that overweight and obesity were associated with significantly increased risk of later cardiometabolic morbidity (diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke) in adult life, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.1-5.1. Nine studies examined associations of child or adolescent overweight and obesity with other adult morbidity: studies of cancer morbidity were inconsistent; child and adolescent overweight and obesity were associated with significantly increased risk of later disability pension, asthma, and polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms. Conclusions: A relatively large and fairly consistent body of evidence now demonstrates that overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence have adverse consequences on premature mortality and physical morbidity in adulthood.

Allergic contact dermatitis, also referred to as contact hypersensitivity, is mediated by CD8+ T cells, which are primed in lymphoid organs during the sensitization phase and are recruited in the skin upon re-exposure to the hapten. Subsets of CD4+ T cells endowed with suppressive activity are responsible for both the down-regulation of eczema in allergic patients and the prevention of priming to haptens in nonallergic individuals. Therefore, ACD should be considered as a breakdown of the skin immune tolerance to haptens. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of ACD have demonstrated the important role of skin innate immunity in the sensitization process and have revisited the dogma that Langerhans cells are mandatory for CD8+ T-cell priming. They have also introduced mast cells as a pivotal actor in the magnitude of the inflammatory reaction. Finally, the most recent studies address the nature, the mode and the site of action of the regulatory T cells that control the skin inflammation with the aim of developing new strategies of tolerance induction in allergic patients.

The vast majority of proteins are tolerated through suppression of cellular or Immoral responses, a process known as oral tolerance. However, in approximately 6% of children and 4% of adults in the United States, tolerance to a given dietary antigen either is not established or breaks down, resulting in food hypersensitivity. Although food allergies can result in sudden and life-threatening symptoms, their prevalence is remarkably low considering the complexities of the gut-associated mucosal system. Suppression involves signaling by an array of nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells, and regulatory T cells, as well as lymphocyte anergy or deletion. Several factors, including antigen properties, route of exposure, and genetics and age of the host, contribute to the development of oral tolerance. Although the current standard of care for patients with food allergies is based on avoidance of the trigger, increased understanding of the mechanisms involved in tolerance has shifted focus of treatment and prevention toward inducing tolerance. Data from early-phase clinical trials suggest both sublingual and oral immunotherapy are effective in reducing sensitivity to allergens. In this article we review the mechanisms of tolerance, discuss aberrations in oral tolerance, and provide information on novel prevention and treatment paradigms for food allergy.	[Burks, A.

Data were collected daily for 12 days. We simultaneously collected PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter <= 10 mu m or <= 2.5 mu m, respectively) filter samples at a central outdoor site, as well as outside and inside the subjects' homes. Personal PM10 filter samples were also collected. All filters were analyzed for mass and light absorbance. We analyzed within-subject associations between health outcomes and air pollution metrics using a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept, controlling for age, ambient relative humidity, and ambient temperature. For the 7 subjects with asthma, a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in 24-hr average outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with a 5.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.9-8.9] and 4.2 ppb (95% CI, 1.3-7.1) increase in FENO, respectively. A 1 mu g/m(3) increase in outdoor, indoor, and personal black carbon (BC) was associated with increases in FENO of 2.3 ppb (95% Cl, 1.1-3.6), 4.0 ppb (95% CI, 2.0-5.9), and 1.2 ppb (95% Cl, 0.2-2.2), respectively. No significant association was found between PM or BC measures and changes in spirometry, blood pressure, pulse rate, or SaO(2) in these subjects. Results from this study indicate that FENO may be a more sensitive market of PM exposure than traditional health outcomes and that particle-associated BC is useful for examining associations between primary combustion constituents of PM and health outcomes.

Methods: A large population of German schoolchildren (n = 3054) was genotyped for deficiencies of the GST isoforms M1 and T1. The association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and asthma as well as atopy was investigated with respect to current and in utero ETS exposure. Results: In children lacking the GSTM1 allele who were exposed to current ETS the risk for current asthma (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 18.6) and asthma symptoms such as wheeze ever (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.0), current wheezing (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 12.6) and shortness of breath (OR 8.9, 95% CI 2.1 to 38.4) was higher than in GSTM1 positive individuals without ETS exposure. Hints of an interaction between ETS exposure and GSTM1 deficiency were identified. In utero smoke exposure in GSTT1 deficient children was associated with significant decrements in lung function compared with GSTT1 positive children not exposed to ETS. Conclusions: GSTM1 and GSTT1 deficiency may increase the adverse health effects of in utero and current smoke exposure.

Data Sources: MEDLINE, personal communication with researchers, the OVID databases, Dissertation Abstracts Online, and BIOSIS. Study Selection: The titles, abstracts, and text of studies from developed countries were explored for breastfeeding exposure measures and lower respiratory tract disease hospitalization rates. For summary statistics, we required 3 inclusion criteria: (1) a feeding contrast of a minimum of 2 months of exclusive breastfeeding (no formula supplementation) vs no breastfeeding and (2) study populations that excluded sick, low birth weight or premature infants and (3) reflected affluent regions; 27% of studies met these criteria. Data Extraction: We abstracted data from all relevant reports. Data Synthesis: Data from all primary material (33 studies) indicated a protective association between breastfeeding and the risk of respiratory disease hospitalization. Nine studies met all inclusion criteria, and 7 cohort studies were pooled. The feeding contrasts in these 7 studies were 4 or more months of exclusive breastfeeding vs no breastfeeding. The summary relative risk (95% confidence interval) was 0.28 (0.14-0.54), using a random-effects model. This effect remained stable and statistically significant after adjusting for the effects of smoking or socioeconomic status. Conclusion: Among generally healthy infants in developed nations, more than a tripling in severe respiratory tract illnesses resulting in hospitalizations was noted for infants who were not breastfed compared with those who were exclusively breastfed for 4 months.

This analysis aimed to estimate the effect of passive smoking on respiratory symptoms, bronchial responsiveness, lung function, and total serum IgE in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey. Methods This analysis included data from 7882 adults (age 20-48 years) who had never smoked, from 36 centres in.16 countries. Information on passive smoking, respiratory symptoms, asthma, and allergic rhinitis was gathered through a structured interview. Spirometry and methacholine challenge were carried out, and total and specific IgE were measured. The effect of passive smoking was estimated by means of logistic and multiple linear regression for each country and combined across countries by random-effects meta-analysis. Findings In 12 of the 36 centres, more than half the participants were regularly involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke. The prevalence of passive smoking in the workplace varied from 2.5% in Uppsala, Sweden, to 53.8% in Galdalkao, Spain. Passive smoking was significantly associated with nocturnal chest tightness (odds ratio 1.28 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.60]), nocturnal breathlessness (1.30 [1.01 to 1.67]), breathlessness after activity (1.25 [1.07 to 1.47]), and increased bronchial responsiveness (effect -0.18 [-0.30 to -0.05]). Passive smoking in the workplace was significantly associated with all types of respiratory symptoms and current asthma (odds ratio 1.90 [95% CI 0.90 to 2.88]). No significant association was found between passive smoking and total serum IgE. Interpretation Passive smoking is common but the prevalence varies widely between different countries, Passive smoking increased the likelihood of experiencing respiratory symptoms and was associated with increased bronchial responsiveness. Decreasing involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke in the community, especially in workplaces, is likely to improve respiratory health.

Methods - Experiments with gas and electric rings, grills, and ovens were used to compare different cooking procedures. Nitrogen oxides (NO,) were measured by a chemiluminescent ML9841A NO, analyser. A TSI 3934 scanning mobility particle sizer was used to measure average number concentration and size distribution of aerosols in the size range 10-500 nm. Results-High concentrations of particles are generated by gas combustion, by frying, and by cooking of fatty foods. Electric rings and grills may also generate particles from their surfaces. In experiments where gas burning was the most important source of particles, most particles were in the size range 15-40 nm. When bacon was fried on the gas or electric rings the particles were of larger diameter, in the size range 50-100 nm. The smaller particles generated during experiments grew in size with time because of coagulation. Substantial concentrations of NO, were generated during cooking on gas; four rings for 15 minutes produced 5 minute peaks of about 1000 ppb nitrogen dioxide and about 2000 ppb nitric oxide. Conclusions - Cooking in a poorly ventilated kitchen may give rise to potentially toxic concentrations of numbers of particles. Very high concentrations of oxides of nitrogen may also be generated by gas cooking, and with no extraction and poor ventilation, may reach concentrations at which adverse health effects may be expected. Although respiratory effects of exposure to NO, might be anticipated, recent epidemiology suggests that cardiac effects cannot be excluded, and further investigation of this is desirable.

It is the underlying principle for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation on substances used in food-contact articles. Further to this, the principle of Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) has been developed and is now used by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in their evaluations. Establishing an accepted TTC would benefit consumers, industry and regulators, since it would preclude extensive toxicity evaluations when Lumen intakes are below such threshold, and direct considerable time and cost resources towards testing substances with the highest potential risk to human health. It was questioned, however, whether specific endpoints that may potentially give rise to low-dose effects would be covered by such threshold. In this review., the possibility of defining a TTC for chemical substances present in the diet was examined for general toxicity endpoints (including carcinogenicity), as well as for specific endpoints, namely neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity and developmental toxicity. For each of these endpoints, a database of specific no-observed-effect levels (NOELs) was compiled by screening oral toxicity studies. The substances recorded in each specific database were selected on the basis of their demonstrated adverse effects. For the neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity databases, it was intended to cover all classes of compounds reported to hare tither a demonstrated neurotoxic or developmentally neurotoxic effect, or at least, on a biochemical or pharmacological basis were considered to have a potential for displaying such effects. For the immunotoxicity endpoint, it was ensured that only immunotoxicants were included in the database by selecting most of the substances from the Luster er al. database, provided that they satisfied the criteria for immunotoxicity defined by Luster. For the developmental toxicity database, substances were selected from the Munro ct nl. database that contained the lowest NOELs retrieved from the literature for more than 600 compounds. After screening these, substances shelving any effect which could point to developmental toxicity as broadly defined by the US EPA (1986) were recorded in the database. Additionally., endocrine toxicity and allergenicity, were addressed as two separate cases, using different approaches and methodology. The distributions of NOELs for the neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity endpoints were compared with the distribution of NOELs for non-specific carcinogenic endpoints. As the immunotoxicity database was too limited to draw such a distribution of immune NOELs, the immunotoxicity endpoint,vas evaluated by comparing immune NOELs (or LOELs-lowest-observed-effect levels-when NOELs were not available),vith non-immune NOELs (or LOELs), in order to compare the sensitivity of this endpoint with non-specific endpoints. A different methodology was adopted for the evaluation of the endocrine toxicity endpoint since data currently available do not permit the establishment of a clear causal link between endocrine active chemicals and adverse effects in humans. Therefore, this endpoint was analysed by estimating the human exposure to oestrogenic environmental chemicals and evaluating their potential impact on human health, based on their contribution to the overall exposure, and their estrogenic potency relative to endogenous hormones. The allergenicity endpoint was not analysed as such. It was addressed in a separate section because this issue is not relevant to the overall population but rather to subsets of susceptible individuals, and allergic risks are usually controlled by other means (i.e, labelling) than the Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach. However, as several researchers are currently examining the existence of a threshold in allergy, the possibility of determining threshold doses for food allergens was put into perspective, and the likelihood for chemical substances to induce allergy at dietary relevant doses was discussed. The analysis indicated that, within the limitation of the databases, developmental neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity were not more sensitive than other non-specific endpoints. Although the cumulative distribution of NOELs for neurotoxic compounds was significantly loner than those for other non-cancer endpoints, these substances were accommodated within the TTC of 1.5 mu g/person/day. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that none of the specific non-cancer endpoints evaluated in the present study was more sensitive than cancer and, that a TTC of 1.5 mu g/person/day based on cancer endpoints provides an adequate margin of safety. Analysis of the immunotoxicity database should that for the group of immunotoxicants examined here, the specific immunotoxic endpoint was not more sensitive than other endpoints. In other words, the distribution of immunotoxic NOELs for these compounds did not appear to differ from the distribution of nonspecific endpoints NOELs for the same compounds. The dietary intakes of environmental oestrogenic chemicals were estimated and their oestrogenic potencies were compared with that of endogenous hormones, in order to assess their impact on human health. The results are in line with scientific data obtained so far, suggesting that estrogenic compounds of anthropogenic origin, in comparison with endogenous hormones, possess only little hormonal activity lilts phytoestrogens. Results of animal studies do not suggest that hormonal effects are to be expected from the rather lon concentrations found in foods. More data are necessary to determine threshold doses for food allergens. However, provided that numerous criteria need to be satisfied before sensitization occurs, it is unlikely that small molecules used in little amounts in foods would induce such reactions. On the basis of the present analysis, which was conducted using conservative assumptions at each step of the procedure (i.e. in data compilation and data analysis), and continually adopting a "worst case" perspective, it can be concluded that a Threshold of Toxicological Concern of 1.5 mu g/person/day provides adequate safety assurance. Chemical substances present in the diet that are consumed at levels below this threshold pose no appreciable risk. Moreover, for compounds which do not possess structural alerts for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, further analysis mag indicate that a higher Threshold of Toxicological Concern mag he appropriate.

In the present study we evaluated the effect of prolonged allergen exposure on airway function and structure in rats. Sensitized Brown Norway rats were repeatedly exposed for periods of 2 4, or 12 wk to aerosolized ovalbumin (OA) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). OA exposure induced a persistent increase in OA-specific serum IgE and in the number of peribronchial eosinophils. After 2 wk of OA exposure, airway histology revealed goblet-cell hyperplasia, an increase in bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in airway epithelium, increased fibronectin deposition, and a thickening of the airway inner wall area. This coincided with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to aerosolized carbachol. After OA exposure for 12 wk, increased fibronectin (p < 0.05 versus PBS) and collagen deposition (p < 0.05 versus PBS) were observed in the submucosa. After 12 wk of exposure, neither total nor inner wall area or airway responsiveness to carbachol were any longer significantly different from those of PBS-exposed animals. In conclusion, prolonged OA exposure in rats induces structural airway changes that bear similarities to airway remodeling in asthma. The study data further indicate that depending on the extent and distribution of remodeling, changes in the extracellular matrix can enhance or protect against AHR.

A total of 141 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was identified, in which 148 telemedicine interventions of various kinds had been tested in a total of 37,695 patients. The value of each intervention was categorised in terms of the outcomes specified by the investigators in that trial, i.e. no attempt was made to extract a common outcome from all studies, as would be required for a conventional meta-analysis. Summarizing the value of these interventions shows, first, that most studies have reported positive effects (n = 108), and almost none have reported negative effects (n = 2). This suggests publication bias. Second, there were no significant differences between the chronic diseases, i.e. telemedicine seems equally effective (or ineffective) in the diseases studied. Third, most studies have been relatively short-term (median duration 6 months). It seems unlikely that in a chronic disease, any intervention can have much effect unless applied for a long period. Finally, there have been very few studies of cost-effectiveness. Thus the evidence base for the value of telemedicine in managing chronic diseases is on the whole weak and contradictory.

However, there is little information about the influence of air pollution on lung injury. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated acute effects of air pollution on pulmonary function and airway oxidative stress and inflammation in asthmatic children. METHODS: We studied 182 children with asthma, 9-14 years of age, for 4 weeks. Daily ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) were monitored from two stations. Once a week we measured spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Fe(NO)), and determined thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 8-isoprostane-two oxidative stress markers-and interieukin-6 (IL-6) in breath condensate. We tested associations using mixed-effects regression models, adjusting for confounding variables. RESULTS: Interquartile-range increases in 3-day average SO(2) (5.4 ppb), NO(2) (6.8 ppb), and PM(2.5) (5.4 mu g/m(3)) were associated with decreases in forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity, with changes being -3.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), -5.8 to -0.3), -2.8% (95% CI, -4.8 to -0.8), and -3.0% (95% CI, -4.7 to -1.2), respectively. SO(2), NO(2), and PM(2.5) were associated with increases in TBARS, with changes being 36.2% (95% CI, 15.7 to 57.2), 21.8% (95% CI, 8.2 to 36.0), and 24.8% (95% CI, 10.8 to 39.4), respectively. Risk estimates appear to be larger in children not taking corticosteroids than in children taking corticosteroids. O(3) (5.3 ppb) was not associated with health end points. Fe(NO), 8-isoprostane, and IL-6 were not associated with air pollutants. CONCLUSION: Air pollution may increase airway oxidative stress and decrease small airway function of asthmatic children. Inhaled corticosteroids may reduce oxidative stress and improve airway function.

Correlation of nitrogen dioxide with other traffic pollutants near a major expressway	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						traffic; air pollution; NO2; VOC; fine particulate matter; ultrafine particles; Toronto; distance decay	AIR-POLLUTION; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; HIGHWAY; INDOOR; ROAD; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; OUTDOOR; ASTHMA	Objectives: This study addresses three objectives: (1) to assess the correlation of NO2 to other ambient pollutants measured with passive samplers; (2) to explore peak traffic particulate matter air pollution correlations with passively measured NO2; and (3) to pilot an advanced mobile air pollution laboratory to supply supplementary information on correlations between NO2 and other air pollutants. Methods: Active and passive monitoring was conducted at two transects perpendicular to an expressway with nearly 400,000 vehicles per day. NO2, NOx, O-3, VOCs, fine-particles and ultrafine particles were measured at increasing distance away from the expressway. The measurement equipment included Ogawa, TraceAir and 3 M organic vapor monitors (OVM-3500) passive samplers, and an array of active measurement equipment: Dust-Trak and P-Trak monitors, chemoluminescent analyzer, aethalometer, tapered element oscillating microbalance, Grimm condensation particle counter, and an lonicon analytik proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer. Results: Levels of NO2 were observed to decay with increasing distance from the expressway, declining to background levels by 300 m. Moderate to high correlations were observed between passive NO2 measurements and passive NOx, O-3 (r similar to 0.60-0.86). The correlations with active PM measurements made with Dust-Trak and P-Trak monitors were in the range 0.64-0.78; correlations between NO2 and VOCs were more variable. Active measurements of NO2 and PM2.5, ultrafine particles, O-3 and black carbon, had high correlations (r similar to 0.7-0.96). Discussion: The variability of many traffic-related pollutants around an expressway is characterized well by passive measurements of NO2. Further research is needed to assess whether these relationships hold in different traffic and land-use environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ARIA Initiative Sci Comm	Common characteristics of upper and lower airways in rhinitis and asthma: ARIA update, in collaboration with GA(2)LEN	ALLERGY			English	Review						allergy; asthma; atopy; review; rhinitis	SEASONAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS; EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE; INDEPENDENT RISK-FACTOR; PRIMARY-SCHOOL CHILDREN; ADULT-ONSET ASTHMA; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; IN-HOUSE DUST; HAY-FEVER; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; ATOPIC ECZEMA	This update aimed to review the new evidence available to support or refute prior Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) statements. A Medline search of publications between 2000 and 2005 was conducted, with articles selected by experts. New evidence supports previous ARIA statements, such as: (i) allergic rhinitis (AR) is a risk factor for asthma; (ii) patients with persistent rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma; (iii) most patients with asthma have rhinitis; (iv) a combined strategy should be used to treat the airways and (v) in low- to middle-income countries, a different strategy may be needed. The increased risk of asthma has also been found among sufferers from non-AR. Recent reports show AR is a global problem. Many studies demonstrated parallel increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis, but in regions of highest prevalence, it may be reaching a plateau. Factors associated with a reduced risk of asthma and AR have been identified, confirming previous findings of protection related to exposure to infections. Treatment of rhinitis with intranasal glucocorticosteroids, antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists or immunotherapy may reduce morbidity because of asthma. To take advantage of the paradigm of unified airways, there is a need to rationalize diagnosis and treatment to optimize management.

primary prevention	FATTY-ACID MODIFICATION; ALLERGEN AVOIDANCE; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; HOUSE-DUST; INFANCY; CHILDREN; REACTIVITY; SYMPTOMS; ATOPY	Background: Avoidance of any one of the individual risk factors associated with childhood asthma has not been successful in preventing its development. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention program for the primary prevention of asthma in high-risk infants at 7 years of age. Methods: Five hundred forty-five high-risk infants with an immediate family history of asthma and allergies were prospectively randomized into intervention or control groups prenatally. Intervention measures introduced before birth and during the first year of life included avoidance of house dust, pets, and environmental tobacco smoke and encouragement of breast-feeding with delayed introduction of solid foods. Assessment of outcomes at 7 years consisted of examination by pediatric allergists, methacboline inhalation tests, and allergy skin tests. Results: At 7 years, 469 of the 545 children were contacted, and 380 returned for further assessment. The prevalence of pediatric allergist-diagnosed asthma was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (14.9% vs 23.0%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79). The prevalence of allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, atopy (defined as positive skin test reactions to any common allergen), and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (defined as the provocative concentration of methacholine that induced a 20% decrease in FEV1 from a postsaline value of less than 7.8 mg/mL) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The prevalence of asthma (defined as wheeze without colds and the presence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness) was also significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (12.9% vs 25.0%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.71).

In a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, resistance is associated with a decreased lung inflammatory pathology and the occurrence of an IL-12-dependent Th1-type reactivity that are both impaired by IL-4, In the present study we assess the ability of Aspergillus crude culture filtrate Ags and the recombinant allergen Asp f 2 to induce protective antifungal responses in mice with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Similar to what occurred upon nasal exposure to viable A. fumigatus conidia, treatment of immunocompetent mice with Aspergillus crude culture filtrate Ags resulted in the development of local and peripheral protective Th1 memory responses, mediated by Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-2 capable of conferring protection upon adoptive transfer to naive recipients. Protective Th1 responses could not be observed in mice deficient of IFN-gamma or IL-12 and did not occur in response to Asp f 2, which, on the contrary, elicited high level production of inhibitory IL-4. The results show that Ags of Aspergillus exist with the ability to induce both Th1- and Th2-type reactivity during infection, a finding that suggests a possible mechanism through which potentially protective immune responses are inhibited in mice with the infection. However, the occurrence of Th1-mediated resistance upon vaccination with Aspergillus crude culture filtrate Ags, suggests the existence of fungal Ags useful as a candidate vaccine against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

In this paper we demonstrate that the airways of mice deficient in a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4D) are no longer responsive to cholinergic stimulation. Airway hyperreactivity that follows exposure to antigen was also abolished in PDE4D(-/-) mice, despite an apparently normal lung inflammatory infiltration. The loss of cholinergic responsiveness was specific to the airway, not observed in the heart, and was associated with a loss of signaling through muscarinic receptors with an inability to decrease cAMP accumulation. These findings demonstrate that the PDE4D gene plays an essential role in cAMP homeostasis and cholinergic stimulation of the airway, and in the development of hyperreactivity. In view of the therapeutic potentials of PDE4 inhibitors, our findings provide the rationale for novel strategies that target a single PDE isoenzyme.

Allergic contact dermatitis-formation, structural requirements, and reactivity of skin sensitizers	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review							LYMPH-NODE ASSAY; OXIDIZED D-LIMONENE; MECHANISTIC APPLICABILITY DOMAINS; HEPATIC CYTOCHROME-P450 ENZYMES; HUMAN DENDRITIC CELLS; IN-VITRO; GUINEA-PIG; 15-HYDROPEROXYABIETIC ACID; OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; P-PHENYLENEDIAMINE	Contact allergy is caused by a wide range of chemicals after skin contact. Its clinical manifestation, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), is developed upon repeated contact with the allergen. This perspective focuses on two areas that have yielded new useful information during the last 20 years: (i) structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of contact allergy based on the concept of hapten-protein binding and (ii) mechanistic investigations regarding activation of nonsensitizing compounds to contact allergens by air oxidation or skin metabolism. The second area is more thoroughly reviewed since the full Picture has previously not been published. Prediction of the sensitizing capacity of a chemical is important to avoid outbreaks of ACD in the population. Much research has been devoted to the development of in vitro and in silico predictive testing methods. Today, no method exists that is sensitive enough to detect weak allergens and that is robust enough to be used for routine screening. To cause sensitization, a chemical C, must bind to macromolecules (proteins) in the skin, Expert systems containing information about the relationship between the chemical structure and the ability of chemicals to haptenate proteins are available. However, few designed SAR studies based on mechanistic investigations of prohaptens have been published. Many compounds are not allergenic themselves but are activated in the skin (e.g., metabolically) or before skin contact (e.g., via air oxidation) to form skin sensitizers. Thus, more basic research is needed on the chemical reactions involved in the antigen formation and the immunological mechanisms. The clinical importance of air oxidation to activate nonallergenic compounds has been demonstrated. Oxidized fragrance terpenes, in contrast to the pure terpenes, gave positive patch test reactions in consecutive dermatitis patients as frequently as the most common standard allergens. This shows the importance of using compounds to which people are exposed when screening for ACD in dermatology clinics.

Severe exacerbations predict excess lung function decline in asthma	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						airways remodelling; exacerbations; prognosis; treatment of asthma	AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; FOLLOW-UP; GENERAL-POPULATION; CORTICOSTEROIDS; POLYMORPHISMS; LIMITATION; DISEASE; ADULTS	Severe asthma exacerbations are periods of intense airway inflammation that have been hypothesised to contribute to structural changes in the airways. If so, accelerated lung function decline over time should be more prevalent in adult patients with asthma who have frequent exacerbations than those without, but to date this has not been demonstrated. A cohort study was performed in order to investigate the effect of severe exacerbations on the progression of airway obstruction in 93 nonsmoking asthmatics with moderate-to-severe disease prior to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. Subjects were followed for >= 5 yrs (median follow-up 11 yrs). In total, 56 (60.2%) subjects experienced at least one severe exacerbation (median rate 0.10.yr(-1)). Oral corticosteroid use and more severe airway obstruction at baseline were associated with a higher exacerbation rate. Independent of these variables, asthma patients with frequent exacerbations had a significantly larger annual decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; median difference (95% confidence interval) 16.9 (1.5-32.2) mL.yr(-1)). Exacerbation rate significantly predicted an excess decline in FEV1, such that one severe exacerbation per year was associated with a 30.2 mL greater annual decline in FEV1. These data support the hypothesis that exacerbations, indicating intermittent periods of worsening airway inflammation, are associated with excess lung function decline in asthma.

Children's exposure to PM is likely to involve both combustion-related ambient PM and PM related to a child's activity in various indoor and outdoor microenvironments. Among 19 children with asthma, 9-17 years of age, we examined the relationship of temporal changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) to personal continuous PM exposure and to 24-hr average gravimetric PM mass measured at home and central sites. Subjects were followed for 2 weeks during either the fall of 1999 or the spring of 2000, in a southern California region affected by transported air pollution. FEV1 was measured by subjects in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Exposure measurements included continuous PM using a passive nephelometer carried by subjects; indoor, outdoor home, and central-site 24-hr gravimetric PM2.5 (PM of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mum) and PM10; and central-site hourly PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Data were analyzed with linear mixed models controlling for within-subject autocorrelation, FEV1 maneuver time, and exposure period. We found inverse associations of FEV1 with increasing PM exposure during the 24 hr before the FEV1 maneuver and with increasing multiday PM averages. Deficits in percent predicted FEV1 (95% confidence interval) for given PM interquartile ranges measured during the preceding 24-hr were as follows: 128 mug/m(3) 1-hr maximum personal PM, -6.0% (-10.5 to -1.4); 30 mug/m(3) 24-hr average personal PM, -5.9% (-10.8 to -1.0); 6.7 mug/m(3) indoor home PM2.5, -1.6% (-2.8 to -0.4); 16 mug/m(3) indoor home PM10, -2.1% (-3.7 to -0.4); 7.1 mug/m(3) outdoor home PM2.5, -1-1% (-2.4 to 0.1); and 7.5 mug/m(3) central-site P-M2.5, -0.7% (-1.9 to 0.4). Stronger associations were found for multiday moving averages of PM for both personal and stationary-site PM. Stronger associations with personal PM were found in boys allergic to indoor allergens. FEV1 was weakly associated with NO2 but not with O-3. Results suggest mixed respiratory effects of PM in asthmatic children from both ambient background exposures and personal exposures in various microenvironments.

Methods: New cases of occupational asthma were collected by a national surveillance programme, based on voluntary reporting, named Observatoire National des Asthmes Professionnels (ONAP), involving a network of occupational and chest physicians. For each case, the reporting form included information on age, sex, location of workplace, occupation, suspected causal agent, and methods of diagnosis. Estimates of the working population, used to calculate incidence rates by age, sex, region, and occupation, were obtained from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE) and from the French Securite Sociale statistics. Results: In 1996-99, 2178 cases of occupational asthma were reported to the ONAP, giving a mean annual rate of 24/million. Rates in men were higher than rates in women (27/million versus 19/million). The highest rate was observed in the 15-29 years age group (30/million). The most frequently incriminated agents were flour (20.3%), isocyanates (14.1%), latex (7.2%), aldehyde (5.9%), persulphate salts (5.8%), and wood dusts (3.7%). The highest risks of occupational asthma were found in bakers and pastry makers (683/million), car painters (326/million), hairdressers (308/million), and Wood workers (218/million). Conclusion: Despite likely underreporting, the number of cases of occupational asthma reported to the ONAP was approximately twice the number of compensated cases over the same period. The relevance of the programme is confirmed by the reproducibility of the results year after year, and its consistency with other surveillance programmes.

We assessed alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux with an extended method of measuring exhaled NO at several exhalation flow rates in 40 patients with asthma, 17 patients with alveolitis, and 57 healthy control subjects. Bronchial NO flux was higher in asthma (2.5 +/- 0.3 nl/s, p < 0.001) than in alveolitis (0.7 +/- 0.1 nl/s) and healthy control subjects (0.7 + 0.1 nl/s). Alveolar NO concentration was higher in alveolitis (4.1 +/- 0.3 ppb, p < 0.001) than in asthma (1.1 +/- 0.2 ppb) and healthy control subjects (1.1 +/- 0.1 ppb). In asthma, bronchial NO flux correlated with serum level of eosinophil protein X (EPX) (r = 0.60, p < 0.001) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). In alveolitis, alveolar NO concentration correlated inversely with pulmonary diffusing capacity (r = -0.55, p = 0.022) and pulmonary restriction. Glucocorticoid treatment or allergen avoidance normalized bronchial NO flux in asthma and decreased alveolar NO concentration toward normal in alveolitis. In conclusion, extended exhaled NO measurement can be used to separately assess alveolar and bronchial inflammation and to assess disease activity/severity in asthma and alveolitis.

However, the reliability of the predictions made with the questionnaires has not been evaluated. To address this issue, we compared objectively measured fungal propagules including the most frequently isolated mold genera (i.e., Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Penicillium, etc.) in a large sample of homes and compared these measured values to the questionnaire-determined household characteristics. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study on the relation between residential allergen exposure and development of asthma in neonates, fungal air samples were collected from infant bedrooms and main living areas in 1000 homes in the Northeast USA, from December 1996 to January 1999. A Burkard portable air sampler was used in combination with DG-18 and MEA agars. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on host and house characteristics that may have an impact on the presence of fungal propagules in the air. This included information on observation of moisture problems (e.g., water leakage or damage, and mold or mildew growth), ventilation and heating facilities, building age and type, number of occupants, annual household income, presence of pets and pests, cleaning regimens, etc. Results: The number of CFU/m(3) air collected on MEA was significantly higher than on DG-18 (means, respectively, 1033.5 and 846.0 CFU/m(3)) (P < 0.0005). However, there was no significant difference between the numbers of CFU/m(3) air collected from the main living area and from the infant bedroom. There was only a very weak relationship between the house characteristics, as described by questionnaire, and the presence of fungal propagules in indoor air. Only the temperature, relative humidity, season, and cats inside homes had a statistically significant impact on the presence of fungal propagules in indoor air. Conclusions: The presence of fungal propagules in indoor air cannot be reliably predicted by home characteristics. Actual measurements are required for fungal exposure assessment, and the use of only;one medium to collect samples in one location in a home might be adequate to represent residential levels of fungi in indoor air.

T cell migration is controlled by a combination of adhesion receptors and chemokines expressed on vascular endothelium and in the tissue, often in an organ-specific manner. This leads to selective accumulation of different T cell subsets, a process called lymphocyte homing. There is evidence for a distinct lung-homing pathway, but no specific lung-homing receptors have been described. We analyzed the chemokine receptor profile of lung T cells to determine the extent to which lung T cells shared homing pathways with other organs such as the gut and skin. In addition, we compared expression of receptors in normal and asthmatic individuals to determine whether different pathways were used in health and disease, We observed that lung T cells expressed a profile of chemokine and adhesion receptors distinct from that of gut- and skin-homing T cells although no chemokine receptor specific for the lung was found. In particular, lung T cells expressed CCR5 and CXCR3, but not CeR9 or cutaneous lymphocyte Ag, and only low levels of CCR4 and alpha (4)beta (7). No differences were observed between lung T cells from normal vs asthmatic subjects. This study provides added support far the concept of a lung-homing pathway separate from other mucosal organs such as the gut and suggests that the chemokine pathways that control T cell migration in normal homeostasis and Th2-type inflammatory responses are similar.

Recently, a new class of estrogens that is abundant in the environment (in industrial chemicals, pesticides, and surfactants) has been recognized. Some of these estrogenic chemicals (which are a large subgroup of endocrine disrupters) have also been shown to influence the immune system. This review assimilates growing evidence in wildlife, laboratory animals and to a limited extent in humans, which suggests that environmental chemicals may also affect the immune system. Further studies are needed to ascertain the immunological consequences of exposure to environmental estrogens, especially in humans. At the present time, it is not known whether the human immune system responds to a low dose of environmental estrogens or if environmental estrogens influence certain subsets of human populations, rather than the general population. Conceivably, an alteration of the immune system by environmental estrogens could affect the individuals' ability to mount well-regulated immune responses to microbial and vaccine antigens, allergens, self and tumor antigens. Possible changes in the immune system must be investigated routinely in toxicity studies. A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of potential immunomodulatory chemicals is needed. In this regard, relevant laboratory animals may be especially useful in identifying susceptible periods of life, whether both genders are equally affected, in analysis of changes in target lymphoid organs, and to determine the immunological effects of mixtures of chemicals.

The integration of T cell migration, differentiation and function	NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CCR7; CD103(+) DENDRITIC CELLS; LYMPH-NODES; CUTTING EDGE; IN-VIVO; RESIDENT MEMORY; ANTIGEN PRESENTATION; PERIPHERAL-TISSUES; HOMING RECEPTOR; L-SELECTIN	T cells function locally. Accordingly, T cells' recognition of antigen, their subsequent activation and differentiation, and their role in the processes of infection control, tumour eradication, autoimmunity, allergy and alloreactivity are intrinsically coupled with migration. Recent discoveries revise our understanding of the regulation and patterns of T cell trafficking and reveal limitations in current paradigms. Here, we review classic and emerging concepts, highlight the challenge of integrating new observations with existing T cell classification schemes and summarize the heuristic framework provided by viewing T cell differentiation and function first through the prism of migration.

Like ultrafine particles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have nano-sized dimensions and a large relative surface area and might thus increase allergic responses. Therefore, we examined whether single-walled (sw) and multi-walled (mw) CNTs have the capacity to promote allergic responses in mice, first in an sc injection model and thereafter in an intranasal model. Balb/cA mice were exposed to three doses of swCNT, mwCNT, as well as ultrafine carbon black particles (ufCBPs, Printex90) during sensitization with the allergen ovalbumin (OVA). Five days after an OVA booster, OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies in serum and the numbers of inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. Furthermore, ex vivo OVA-induced cytokine release from mediastinal lymph node (MLN) cells was measured. In separate experiments, differential cell counts were determined in BALF 24 h after a single intranasal exposure to the particles in the absence of allergen. We demonstrate that both swCNT and mwCNT together with OVA strongly increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, the number of eosinophils in BALF, and the secretion of Th2-associated cytokines in the MLN. On the other hand, only mwCNT and ufCBP with OVA increased IgG2a levels, neutrophil cell numbers, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in BALF, as well as the acute influx of neutrophils after exposure to the particles alone. This study demonstrates that CNTs promote allergic responses in mice.

Altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years of age	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						allergy; bifidobacteria; Clostridium difficile; endotoxin; Fel d 1; gut microbiota; infant; lactobacilli; siblings	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; SPECIES-SPECIFIC PRIMERS; REAL-TIME PCR; SWEDISH INFANTS; ATOPIC ECZEMA; INTESTINAL BIFIDOBACTERIA; FECAL MICROBIOTA; ENDOTOXIN LEVELS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; HOUSE-DUST	Early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while Clostridium (C.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. Previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. To relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 Swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and Fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. Primers binding to C. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis were used. Children regarded as allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. Children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group I (Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus, L. casei, L. paracasei), Bifidobacterium adolescentis and C. difficile during their first 2 months. Infants colonized with several Bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. A more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy, family size and endotoxin exposure.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO0.05)), a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, can be measured at home. Objectives: We assessed daily FE(NO0.05) telemonitoring in the management of childhood asthma. Methods: Children with atopic asthma (n = 151) were randomly assigned to two groups: FE(NO0.05) Plus symptom monitoring, or monitoring of symptoms only. All patients scored asthma symptoms in an electronic diary over 30 weeks; 77 received a portable nitric oxide (NO) analyzer. Data were transmitted daily to the coordinating centers. Patients were phoned every 3 weeks and their steroid dose was adapted according to FE(NO0.05) and symptoms, or according to symptoms. Children were seen at 3, 12, 21, and 30 weeks for examination and lung function testing. The primary end point was the proportion of symptom-free days in the last 12 study weeks. Measurements and Main Results: Telemonitoring was feasible with reliable FE(NO0.05) data for 86% of days, and valid diary entries for 79% of days. Both groups showed an increase in symptom-free days, improvement of FEV(1) and quality of life, and a reduction in steroid dose. None of the changes from baseline differed between groups. The difference in symptom-free days over the last 12 weeks was 0.3% (P = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, -10 to 11%). There was a trend for fewer exacerbations in the FE(NO0.05) group. Conclusions: Thirty weeks of daily FENO(0.05) and symptom telemonitoring was associated with improved asthma control and a lower steroid dose. We found no added value of daily FENO(0.05) monitoring compared with daily symptom monitoring only.

The latter includes epithelial cells ( e. g. keratinocytes, urothelium, gastric epithelial cells, enterocytes, and pneumocytes) through vascular endothelium and cells of the immune system ( e. g. T-cells and mast cells) to smooth muscle, fibroblasts and hepatocytes. Despite extensive research, the physiological function of TRPV1 in the brain and in non-neuronal tissues remains elusive. The preliminary results are exciting, but many are unconfirmed and/ or contradictory. As yet, studies with TRPV1 knock-out mice have proven unhelpful in clarifying such biological roles. Now that a range of potent and selective TRPV1 antagonists are available in this rapidly expanding research field, further understanding of the biological roles of TRPV1 throughout the body is within reach. In this article, we will summarize the known roles of peripheral TRPV1 receptors in physiology and disease and review the current perspectives for the therapeutic potential of TRPV1 agonists and antagonists in the treatment of a wide range of conditions such as pain, cancer, migraine, chronic cough, asthma, rectal hypersensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, overactive bladder and diabetes. New applications of targeting central TRPV1 receptors are reviewed in the accompanying article by Starowicz et al. ( in this issue).

The Xyzal in Persistent Rhinitis Trial is the first large, long-term clinical trial studying patients with persistent rhinitis as defined by Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma. Objectives: Two primary objectives were defined: comparison of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire overall score and Total 5 Symptoms Score (rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal and ocular pruritus) over a period of 4 weeks between levocetirizine 5 mg and placebo. Secondary endpoints included similar evaluations at 1 week and 3, 4.5, and 6 months, summary scores for a general health status questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36), a pharmacoeconomic assessment, comorbidities, and a safety evaluation. Methods: The Xyzal in Persistent Rhinitis Trial was a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trial in 551 patients. Adults with persistent rhinitis sensitized to both grass pollen and house dust mite were randomized to receive levocetirizine 5 mg/d or placebo. Results: A total of 421 patients completed the full study. Levocetirizine significantly improved both the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire overall score and the Total 5 Symptoms Score from week 1 to 6 months (all P values < .001). Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 summary scores were also improved in the levocetirizine group compared with the placebo group. Treatment cessation because of lack of effect, comorbidities, and overall costs of disease, and comorbidities per working patient per month (E160.27 vs E108.18) were lower in the levocetirizine group. Conclusion: Levocetirizine was shown to improve quality of life and symptoms and to decrease the overall costs of the disease over the 6-month treatment period.

Despite this, there is still very little information about the immunological effects of maternal smoking on the fetus. Methods: This aim of this study was to compare cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) cytokine responses to allergens [ ovalbumin ( OVA) or house dust mite (HDM)] and mitogens [ concanavalin A ( ConA) or phytohemaglutinen (PHA)] in neonates whose mothers smoked throughout pregnancy ( n = 17) with responses of neonates whose mothers never smoked ( n = 40). Cell cultures were stimulated for 24 h and supernatants collected for cytokine detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ interleukin (IL)-13, IL-6, interferon (IFN) gamma and IL-10]. Cell pellets were also collected for cytokine mRNA detection (IL-5, IL-9, IFNgamma). Results: Maternal smoking in pregnancy was associated with significantly higher neonatal T helper type 2 (IL-13 protein) responses to both HDM ( P = 0.01) and OVA ( P = 0.035). These effects remained statistically significant after allowing for confounding factors, including the effects of maternal atopy. Similar trends were also seen for IL-9mRNA, IL-5mRNA and IL-6 responses, although these were not statistically significant. Although IFNgamma mRNA responses to PHA ( P = 0.015) and ConA ( P = 0.025) were lower if mothers smoked in pregnancy, there were no differences in neonatal (Th1) IFNgamma protein responses to allergens or mitogens. Conclusions: These findings indicate that maternal cigarette smoking can modify aspects of fetal immune function and highlight the need for further studies in this area.

The mouse is increasingly used in these models, mainly because this species allows for the application in vivo of a broad range of immunological tools, including gene deletion technology. Mice, therefore, seem particularly useful to further elucidate factors influencing the response to inhaled allergens. Examples include: the role of immunoregulatory mechanisms that protect against T-helper cell type 2 cell development; the trafficking of T-cells; and the contribution of the innate immunity. However, as for other animal species, murine models also have limitations. Mice do not spontaneously develop asthma and no model mimics the entire asthma phenotype. Instead, mice should be used to model specific traits of the human disease. The present task force report draws attention to specific aspects of lung structure and function that need to be borne in mind when developing such models and interpreting the results. In particular, efforts should be made to develop models that mimic the lung function changes characteristic of asthma as closely as possible. A large section of this report is therefore devoted to an overview of airway function and its measurement in mice.

Previous studies of gastroschisis have suggested that risk is increased for maternal use of vasoactive over-the-counter medications, including specific analgesics and decongestants. This retrospective study evaluated the relation between maternal use of cough/cold/analgesic medications and risks of gastroschisis and SIA. From 1995 to 1999, the mothers of 206 gastroschisis cases, 126 SIA cases, and 798 controls in the United States and Canada were interviewed about medication use and illnesses. Risks of gastroschisis were elevated for use of aspirin (odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 5.9), pseudoephedrine (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.2), acetaminophen (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 2.2), and pseudoephedrine combined with acetaminophen (odds ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.9, 9.2). Risks of SIA were increased for any use of pseudoephedrine (odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 4.0) and for use of pseudoephedrine in combination with acetaminophen (odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 8.0). Reported fever, upper respiratory infection, and allergy were not associated with risks of either defect. These findings add more evidence that aspirin use in early pregnancy increases risk of gastroschisis. Although pseudoephedrine has previously been shown to increase gastroschisis risk, findings of this study raise questions about interactions between medications and possible confounding by underlying illness.

Objective: We performed a follow-up of the German Infant Nutritional Intervention study until 6 years of life to investigate the long-term allergy-preventive effect of 3 hydrolyzed infant formulas compared with cow's milk formula (CMF) in a randomized, double-blind trial. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, 2252 newborns with atopic heredity were randomly assigned at birth to receive one of 4 blinded formulas: partially or extensively hydrolyzed whey formula, extensively hydrolyzed casein formula, or CMF as milk substitute for the first 4 months when breast-feeding was insufficient. The cohort was followed from birth until 6 years of age with yearly questionnaires. Outcomes were physician-diagnosed allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic urticaria, asthma, and hay fever/allergic rhinitis). Log-binomial regression modeled with generalized estimation equations was used for the statistical analysis. Results: In the intent-to-treat analysis the relative risk of a physician's diagnosis of allergic manifestation (AM) compared with CMF was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.96) for partially hydrolyzed whey formula, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04) for extensively hydrolyzed whey formula, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69-0.93) for extensively hydrolyzed casein formula. The corresponding figures for atopic eczema were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64-0.97), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.76-1.11), and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88), respectively. In the per-protocol analysis all effects were stronger and significant. No significant effect on other AMs was found. Conclusion: The data confirm a long-term allergy-preventive effect of hydrolyzed infant formulas on AM and atopic eczema until 6 years of age.

Stress and inflammation in exacerbations of asthma	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Review						stress; asthma; cytokines; glucocorticoids; autonomic nervous system	PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CYTOKINE PROFILES; COMMON COLD; EXPRESSION; CHILDREN; ATOPY; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ADOLESCENTS	In this mini-review, we outline a model depicting the immunologic mechanisms by which psychological stress can exacerbate clinical symptoms in patients with asthma. This model highlights the importance of both social and physical exposures in the exacerbation of asthma symptoms. The basic premise of the model is that psychological stress operates by altering the magnitude of the airway inflammatory response that irritants, allergens, and infections bring about in persons with asthma. The biological pathways for how stress amplifies the immune response to asthma triggers include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, and the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) arms of the autonomic nervous system. Empirical evidence for this model is reviewed, and conclusions and future research directions are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reversal of airway hyperresponsiveness by induction of airway mucosal CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							DENDRITIC CELLS; INHALED ANTIGEN; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; ASTHMATIC REACTIONS; IGE RESPONSES; IN-VIVO; ALLERGEN; HYPERREACTIVITY; INFLAMMATION; SUPPRESSION	An important feature of atopic asthma is the T cell-driven late phase reaction involving transient bronchoconstriction followed by development of airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Using a unique rat asthma model we recently showed that the onset and duration of the aeroallergen-induced airway mucosal T cell activation response in sensitized rats is determined by the kinetics of functional maturation of resident airway mucosal dendritic cells (AMDCs) mediated by cognate interactions with CD4(+) T helper memory cells. The study below extends these investigations to chronic aeroallergen exposure. We demonstrate that prevention of ensuing cycles of T cell activation and resultant AHR during chronic exposure of sensitized rats to allergen aerosols is mediated by CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) LAG3(+) CTLA(+) CD45RC(+) T cells which appear in the airway mucosa and regional lymph nodes within 24 h of initiation of exposure, and inhibit subsequent Th-mediated upregulation of AMDC functions. These cells exhibit potent regulatory T (T reg) cell activity in both in vivo and ex vivo assay systems. The maintenance of protective T reg activity is absolutely dependent on continuing allergen stimulation, as interruption of exposure leads to waning of T reg activity and reemergence of sensitivity to aeroallergen exposure manifesting as AMDC/T cell upregulation and resurgence of T helper 2 cytokine expression, airways eosinophilia, and AHR.

We, therefore, examined the time course of changes in respiratory input impedance during induced bronchoconstriction in BALB/c mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Our results indicate that bronchoconstriction in mice is accompanied by complete closure of substantial regions of the lung and that closure increases markedly when the lungs are allergically inflamed. With the aid of an anatomically accurate computational model of the mouse lung, we show that the hyperresponsiveness of mice with allergically inflamed airways can be explained entirely by a thickening of the airway mucosa and an increased propensity of the airways to close, without the involvement of any increase in the degree of airway smooth muscle shortening. This has implications for the pathophysiology of asthma and suggests that at least some types of asthma may benefit from therapies aimed at manipulating surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the lungs.

Objective: We sought to determine whether GSTP1 polymorphism influences susceptibility to asthma induced by toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Methods: The role of GSTP1 was assessed in 131 workers exposed to TDI, 92 with TDI-induced asthma and 39 asymptomatic subjects. The phenotype of the disease was characterized by using detailed clinical history, lung volumes, airway responsiveness to methacholine, and airway responsiveness to TDI. GST genotypes were determined by using PCR-based assays. Results: In patients exposed to TDI for 10 or more years, the frequency of the GSTP1 Val/Val genotype was lower in subjects who had asthma (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.13; P = .074). Similarly, the frequency of this genotype was significantly lower in subjects with evidence of moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine compared with the frequency in subjects with normal or mild hyperresponsiveness (P = .033). Conclusion: These data suggest that homozygosity for the GSTP1*Val allele confers protection against TDI-induced asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness. This view is supported by the finding that the protective effect increases in proportion to the duration of exposure to TDI.

These essentially comprised countries in Europe as well as the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Methods-Tuberculosis notification rates were obtained from the World Health Organization. Data on the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in 235 477 children aged 13-14 years were based on the responses to the written and video questionnaires from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The analysis was adjusted for gross national product (GNP) as an estimate of the level of affluence. Results-Tuberculosis notification rates were significantly inversely associated with the lifetime prevalence of wheeze and asthma and the 12 month period prevalence of wheeze at rest as assessed by the video questionnaire. An increase in the tuberculosis notification rates of 25 per 100 000 was associated with an absolute decrease in the prevalence of wheeze ever of 4.7%. Symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the past 12 months were inversely associated with tuberculosis notification rates, but there were no other significant associations with other ISAAC questions on allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or atopic eczema. Conclusions-These findings are consistent with recent experimental evidence which suggests that exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis may reduce the risk of developing asthma.

However, recent studies also highlight an important role for diet and bacterial metabolites in controlling various immune pathways, including gut and immune homeostasis, regulatory T cell biology, and inflammation. Dietary-related metabolites engage "metabolite-sensing'' G-protein-coupled receptors, such as GPR43, GPR41, GPR109A, GPR120, and GPR35. These receptors are expressed on immune cells and some gut epithelial cells and generally mediate a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Insufficient intake of "healthy foodstuffs'' adversely affects the production of bacterial metabolites. These metabolites and those derived directly from food drive beneficial downstream effects on immune pathways. We propose that insufficient exposure to dietary and bacterial metabolites might underlie the development of inflammatory disorders in Western countries. This review highlights what is currently known about diet, metabolites, and their associated immune pathways in relation to the development of inflammatory disease.

Exactly how the environment changes gene expression and how this can lead to disease are being explored in a fruitful new approach to environmental health research, representative studies of which are reviewed here. DATA SOURCES: We searched Web of Science and references of relevant publications to understand the diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms affected by environmental exposures with disease implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, air pollutants, industrial chemicals, heavy metals, hormones, nutrition, and behavior can change gene expression through a broad array of gene regulatory mechanisms. Mechanisms include regulation of gene translocation, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA repair, transcription, RNA stability, alternative RNA splicing, protein degradation, gene copy number, and transposon activation. Furthermore, chemically induced changes in gene regulation are associated with serious and complex human diseases, including cancer, diabetes and obesity, infertility, respiratory diseases, allergies, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. One of the best-studied areas of gene regulation is epigenetics, especially DNA methylation. Our examples of environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation are presented in the context of early development, when methylation patterns are initially laid down. This approach highlights the potential role for altered DNA methylation in fetal origins of adult disease and inheritance of acquired genetic change. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies indicate that genetic predisposition for disease is best predicted in the context of environmental exposures. Second, the genetic mechanisms investigated in these studies offer new avenues for risk assessment research. Finally, we are likely to witness dramatic improvements in human health, and reductions in medical costs, if environmental pollution is decreased.

Inconsistent data on the relation of farming to asthma and wheeze have raised some doubt about a true protective effect. Objective: We sought to study the differential effects of farm-associated exposures on specific asthma-related health outcomes. Methods: The cross-sectional Prevention of Allergy Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle study included 8263 school-age children from rural areas in 5 European countries. Information on farm-related exposures and health outcomes was obtained by using questionnaires. In subsamples allergen-specific IgE and RNA expression of CD14 and Toll-like receptor genes were measured, and dust from children's mattresses was evaluated for microbial components. Results: Inverse relations with a diagnosis of asthma were found for pig keeping (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.86), farm milk consumption (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.99), frequent stay in animal sheds (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95), child's involvement in haying (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.81), and use of silage (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98; for nonatopic asthma) and in Germany for agriculture (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.53). Protective factors were related with higher expression levels of genes of the innate immunity. Potential risk factors for asthma and wheeze were also identified in the farm milieu. Levels of endotoxin and extracellular polysaccharides were related to the health outcomes independently of the farm exposures. Conclusions: The protective effect of being raised in a farm environment was ascribed to distinct exposures. Clinical implications: The development of atopic sensitization and atopic and nonatopic asthma is most likely determined by different environmental factors, possibly reflecting distinct pathomechanisms.

Objective: To gain insight toward devising interventions, we queried risk-taking behaviors and coping strategies of persons age 13 to 21 years with food allergy. Methods: We used an Internet-based anonymous questionnaire devised on the basis of data from focus groups. Results: Participants (174 subjects; 49% male; mean age, 16 years) reported the following: 75% had peanut allergy, 75% had 2 or more food allergies, and 87% had been prescribed self-injectable epinephrine. Regarding risk taking, 61% reported that they "always" carry self-injectable epinephrine, but frequencies varied according to activities: traveling (94%), restaurants (81%), friends' homes (67%), school dance (61%), wearing tight clothes (53%), and sports (43%). Fifty-four percent indicated purposefully ingesting a potentially unsafe food. Willingness to eat a food labeled "may contain" an allergen was reported by 42%. Twenty-nine participants were designated at high risk because they did not always carry epinephrine and ate foods that "may contain" allergens. The high-risk group, compared with the rest of the participants (P < .05), felt less "concern" about and "different" because of their allergy and had more recent reactions. The high-risk group was not distinguishable (P = not significant) by age, sex, or number or severity of reactions. Participants variably (60%) tell their friends about their allergy, but 68% believe education of their friends would make living with food allergy easier. Conclusions: A significant number of teens with food allergy admit to risk taking that varies by social circumstances and perceived risks. The results imply that education of teenagers and, importantly, those around them during social activities might reduce risk taking and its consequences. Clinical implications: Our survey of adolescents and young adults with food allergy revealed risk-taking behaviors that vary by social circumstances and perceived risks, indicating that education of teenagers and their peers might reduce risk taking and its consequences.

The increasing prevalence and severity of atopic diseases including AD over the last three decades has been attributed to decreased exposure to microorganisms during early life, which may result in an altered Th-1/Th-2-balance and/or reduced T cell regulation of the immune response. Patients with AD exhibit defects in innate and acquired immune responses resulting in a heightened susceptibility to bacterial, fungal and viral infections, most notably colonization by S. aureus. Toxins produced by S. aureus exacerbate disease activity by both the induction of toxin-specific IgE and the activation of various cell types including Th-2 cells, eosinophils and keratinocytes. Allergens expressed by the yeast Malazessia furfur, a component of normal skin flora, have also been implicated in disease pathogenesis in a subset of AD patients. Microorganisms play an influential role in AD pathogenesis, interacting with disease susceptibility genes to cause initiation and/or exacerbation of disease activity.			drbsbaker@aol.com					Ahmad-Nejad P, 2004, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V113, P565, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2003.12.583;

Objective To see whether use of paracetamol in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma, wheezing and other atopic outcomes in the child at school age. Methods In the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we measured associations of paracetamol and aspirin use in late pregnancy (20-32 weeks) with asthma, hayfever, eczema (n=8511) and wheezing (8381) in the offspring at 69-81 months, and with atopy (positive skin prick test to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cat or grass, n=6527) and blood total IgE (n=5148) at 7 years. We used logistic and linear regression to analyse binary outcomes and log-transformed IgE, respectively, controlling for potential confounders. Results Use of paracetamol, but not aspirin, in late pregnancy was positively associated with asthma (odds ratios (ORs), comparing children whose mothers took paracetamol 'sometimes' and 'most days/daily' with those whose mothers never took it, 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.41) and 1.62 (95% CI: 0.86-3.04), respectively; P trend=0.0037), wheezing (ORs 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02-1.40) and 1.86 (95% CI: 0.98-3.55), respectively; P trend=0.011), and total IgE (geometric mean ratios 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03-1.26) and 1.52 (95% CI: 0.98-2.38), respectively; P trend=0.0034), but not hayfever, eczema or skin test positivity. The proportion of asthma attributable to paracetamol use in late pregnancy, assuming a causal relation, was 7%. Conclusion: Paracetamol exposure in late gestation may cause asthma, wheezing and elevated IgE in children of school age.

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pet exposure and genotype on immunologic development and the incidence of atopic markers and diseases in the first year of life. Methods: Pet exposure in the home was compared with cytokine secretion patterns (mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells at birth and age 1 year) and indicators of atopy (allergen-specific and total IgE, eosinophilia, food allergy, atopic dermatitis) in 285 infants. Interactions with genotype at the CD14 locus were also evaluated in the data analyses. Results: Exposure to dogs was associated with reduced allergen sensitization (19% vs 33%, P =.020) and atopic dermatitis (30% vs 51%, P < .001). The risk for atopic dermatitis was further influenced by genotype at the CD14 locus (P =.006), even after adjusting for exposure to dogs (P =.003). Furthermore, infants with the genotype -159TT were less likely to develop atopic dermatitis if they were exposed to a dog (5% vs 43%, P =.04). Last, dog exposure was associated with increased IL-10 (117 vs 79 pg/mL, P =.002) and IL-13 (280 vs 226 pg/mL, P =.013) responses at age 1 year. Conclusions: Having a dog in infancy is associated with higher IL-10 and IL-13 cytokine secretion profiles and reduced allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis. These findings suggest that postnatal exposure to dogs can influence immune development in a genotype-specific fashion and thereby attenuate the development of atopy in at-risk children.

Among the factors implicated in this "epidemic" are indoor and outdoor airborne pollutants. Urbanisation with its high levels of vehicle emissions and Westernised lifestyle parallels the increase in respiratory allergy in most industrialised countries, and people who live in urban areas tend to be more affected by the disease than those of rural areas. In atopic subjects, exposure to air pollution increases airway responsiveness to aeroallergens. Pollen is a good model with which to study the interrelationship between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases. Biological aerosols carrying antigenic proteins, such as pollen grains or plant-derived paucimicronic components, can produce allergic symptoms. By adhering to the surface of these airborne allergenic agents, air pollutants could modify their antigenic properties. Several factors influence this interaction, i.e., type of air pollutant, plant species, nutrient balance, climatic factors, degree of airway sensitisation and hyperresponsiveness of exposed subjects. However, the airway mucosal damage and the impaired mucociliary clearance induced by air pollution may facilitate the penetration and the access of inhaled allergens to the cells of the immune system, and so promote airway sensitisation. As a consequence, an enhanced immunoglobulin E-mediated response to aeroallergens and enhanced airway inflammation favoured by air pollution could account for the increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases in urban areas.

To study this, we identified 410 children, 6-12 yr of age, who were being treated for asthma (inhaled steroids and beta -agonists), were allergic to cats, and had no Eat at home. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptoms, medication, fever and/or sore throat, and contact with furred pets were recorded twice daily during the last week of summer holidays and the second and third weeks of school. The number of cat owners in each class was recorded. Ninety-two children with asthma reported no contact with furred pets. Among these, children who attended classes with > 18% (median value) cat owners reported significantly decreased PEF, more days with asthma symptoms, and increased use of medication after school started. Those in classes with less than or equal to 18% cat owners reported no change. Children in classes with many cat owners ran a 9-fold increased risk of exacerbated asthma after school start compared with children in classes with few cat owners, after adjusting for age, sex, and fever and/or sore throat. Thus, asthma symptoms, PEF, and the use of asthma medication in children with cat allergy may be affected by indirect cat exposure at school.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of mycobacterial antigens to atopic individuals might ameliorate their disease. Methods: Forty-one children aged 5 to 18 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, where they were given either one intradermal injection of killed Mycobacterium vaccae (SRL 172) or buffer solution (placebo). Changes in skin surface area affected by dermatitis and dermatitis severity score were assessed before treatment and at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Results: Children treated with SRL 172 showed a mean 48% (95% CI, 32%-65%) reduction in surface area affected by dermatitis compared with a mean 4% (95% CI, -29% to 22%) reduction for the placebo group (P < .001) and a median 68% (interquartile range, 46%-85%) reduction in dermatitis severity score compared with 18% (interquartile range, -2% to 34%) for the placebo group (P < .01) at 3 months after treatment. There were no untoward effects of the treatment, apart from a local reaction in 13 of the 21 children, which occurred 1 month after SRL 172 administration and settled spontaneously. Conclusion: SRL 172 was associated with an improvement in the severity of the dermatitis in children with moderate-to-severe disease.

Because of heterogeneity of the airway response to different stimuli, the latter have been divided into direct and indirect stimuli. Direct stimuli cause airflow limitation by a direct action on the effector cells involved in the airflow limitation, while indirect stimuli exert their action essentially on inflammatory and neuronal cells that act as an intermediary between the stimulus and the effector cells. This manuscript reviews the clinical and experimental studies on the mechanisms involved in indirect BHR in patients with asthma. Pharmacological stimuli (adenosine, tachykinins, bradykinin, sodium metabisulphite/sulphur dioxide, and propranolol) as well as physical stimuli (exercise, nonisotonic aerosols, and isocapnic hyperventilation) are discussed. The results of the different direct and indirect bronchial challenge tests are only weakly correlated and are therefore not mutually interchangeable. Limited available data (studies on the effects of allergen avoidance and inhaled corticosteroids) suggest that indirectly acting bronchial stimuli (especially adenosine) might better reflect the degree of airway inflammation than directly acting stimuli. It remains to be established whether monitoring of indirect BHR as a surrogate marker of inflammation tin addition to symptoms and lung function) is of clinical relevance to the long-term management of asthmatic patients. This seems to be the case for the direct stimulus methacholine. More work needs to be performed to find out whether, indirect stimuli are more suitable in asthma monitoring than direct ones. Recommendations on the application of indirect challenges in clinical practice and research will shortly be available from the European Respiratory Society Task Force.

Methods: Twenty-three elite cold weather athletes (14 men, 9 women) PFT positive for EIA (FBC screened) served as subjects. Twenty-three gender and sport matched Controls (nonasthmatics) were randomly selected to establish PFT reference values for normal elite athletes. Before FBC, athletes completed a medical history questionnaire for EIA symptoms. FBC evaluations consisted of baseline spirometry, actual or simulated competition, and 5, 10, and 15 min postexercise spirometry. PFT positive athletes were evaluated in the laboratory using an exercise challenge simulating race intensity (ambient conditions: 21 degrees C, 60% relative humidity). PFT procedures were identical to FBC. Results: 91%, of PFT positive and 48% of PFT normal athletes reported at least one symptom of EIA, with postrace cough most frequent. Baseline spirometry was the same for PFT positives and normal controls. Lower limit reference range (MN - 2 SD) of FEV1 for controls suggests that postexercise decrements of greater than similar to-7% indicate abnormal airway response in this population. Exercise time duration did not effect bronchial reactivity; 78% of FBC PFT positives; were PFT normal post-LBC. Conclusion: Self-reported symptoms by elite athletes are not reliable in identifying EIA. Reference range criterion for FEV1 decrement in the elite athlete postexercise contrasts current recommended guidelines. Moreover, a large number of false negatives may occur in this population if EIA screening is performed with inadequate exercise and environmental stress.

Objective To study the association between natural measles infection and atopy, Design and Setting Cross-sectional nationwide study in Finland using data gathered between November 1, 1982, and June 30, 1986. Subjects A total of 547 910 individuals aged 14 months to 19 years who at the time of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination had relevant information collected on the occurrence of measles and allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. Main Outcome Measures Lifetime occurrence of atopic manifestations in subjects who had had measles compared with those who had not, expressed as age-specific and age-adjusted prevalence ratios. Results The age-adjusted prevalence ratio of atopic manifestations among those who had had measles (n = 20 690) compared with those who had not (n = 527 220) was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.36) for eczema, 1.41 (95% CI, 1.33-1.49) for rhinitis, and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.54-1.79) for asthma. The positive association between measles and atopy was evident at all ages, in both urban and rural dwellers, and among subjects with many or few contacts at home or in day care. Conclusions Based on our data, measles and atopy occur more frequently together than expected, which does not support the hypothesis that experiencing natural measles infection offers protection against atopic disease.

Inhaled Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Potentiate Airway Fibrosis in Murine Allergic Asthma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						carbon nanotubes; asthma; fibrosis; lung	INTRATRACHEAL INSTILLATION; PULMONARY TOXICITY; MICE; PARTICLES; INTERLEUKIN-13; FIBROBLASTS; DEPOSITION; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE	Carbon nanotubes are gaining increasing attention due to possible health risks from occupational or environmental exposures. This study tested the hypothesis that inhaled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) would increase airway fibrosis in mice with allergic asthma. Normal and ovalbumin-sensitized mice were exposed to a MWCNT aerosol (100 mg/m(3)) or saline aerosol for 6 hours. Lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis were examined by histopathology, clinical chemistry, ELISA, or RT-PCR for cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, and Collagen at 1 and 14 days after inhalation. Inhaled MWCNT were distributed throughout the lung and found in macrophages by light microscopy, but were also evident in epithelial cells by electron microscopy. Quantitative morphometry showed significant airway fibrosis at 14 days in mice that received a combination of ovalbumin and MWCNT, but not in mice that received ovalbumin or MWCNT only. Ovalbumin-sensitized mice that did not inhale MWCNT had elevated levels IL-13 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 in lung lavage fluid, but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA. In contrast, unsensitized mice that inhaled MWCNT had elevated PDGF-AA, but not increased levels of TGF-beta 1 and IL-13. This suggested that airway fibrosis resulting from combined ovalbumin sensitization and MWCNT inhalation requires PDGF, a potent fibroblast mitogen, and TGF-beta 1, which stimulates Collagen production. Combined ovalbumin sensitization and MWCNT inhalation also synergistically increased IL-5 mRNA levels, which could further contribute to airway fibrosis. These data indicate that inhaled MWCNT require pre-existing inflammation to cause airway fibrosis. Our findings suggest that individuals with pre-existing allergic inflammation may be susceptible to airway fibrosis from inhaled MWCNT.

This study was designed to address two hypotheses: (1) air trapping measured by multidetector CT (MDCT) quantitative methodology would be a predictor of a more severe asthma phenotype; and (2) historical, clinical, allergic, or inflammatory risk factors could be identified via multivariate analysis. Methods: MDCT scanning of a subset of Severe Asthma Research Program subjects ,vas performed at functional residual capacity. Air trapping was defined as >= 9.66% of the lung tissue < - 850 Hounsfield units (HU). Subjects classified as having air trapping were then compared to subjects without air trapping on clinical and demographic factors using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results: Subjects with air trapping were significantly more likely to have a history of asthma-related hospitalizations, ICU visits, and/or mechanical ventilation.. Duration of asthma a (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.87), history pneumonia (OR, 8.55; 95% CI, 2.07 to 35.26), high levels of airway neutrophils (OR, 8.67; 95% CI, 2.05 to 36.57), airflow obstruction (FEN(1)/FVC) OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.14], and atopy (OR, 11.54; 95% CI, 1.97 to 67.70) were identified as independent risk factors associated with the air-trapping phenotype. Conclusions: Quantitative CT-determined air trapping in asthmatic subjects identifies a group of individuals it high risk for severe disease. Several independent risk factors for the presence of this phenotype were identified: perhaps most interestingly, history of Pneumonia, neutrophilic inflammation, and atopy.

There is mounting concern that the current recommended practice of delaying complementary foods until 6 months of age may increase, rather than decrease, the risk of immune disorders. Tolerance to food allergens appears to be driven by regular, early exposure to these proteins during a 'critical early window' of development. Although the timing of this window is not clear in humans, current evidence suggests that this is most likely to be between 4 and 6 months of life and that delayed exposure beyond this period may increase the risk of food allergy, coeliac disease and islet cell autoimmunity. There is also evidence that other factors such as favourable colonization and continued breastfeeding promote tolerance and have protective effects during this period when complementary feeding is initiated. This discussion paper explores the basis for concern over the current recommendation to delay complementary foods as an approach to preventing allergic disease. It will also examine the growing case for introducing complementary foods from around 4 months of age and maintaining breastfeeding during this early feeding period, for at least 6 months if possible.

IFN-GAMMA GENE; CELL DIFFERENTIATION; TH2 DIFFERENTIATION; AIR-POLLUTION; EXPRESSION; PROMOTER; CPG; DEMETHYLATION; TRANSCRIPTION; ENVIRONMENT	Changes in methylation of CpG sites at the interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma promoters are associated with T helper (Th) 2 polarization in vitro. No previous studies have examined whether air pollution or allergen exposure alters methylation of these two genes in vivo. We hypothesized that diesel exhaust particles (DEP) would induce hypermethylation of the IFN-gamma promoter and hypomethylation of IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells among mice sensitized to the fungus allergen Aspergillus fumigatus. We also hypothesized that DEP-induced methylation changes would affect immunoglobulin (Ig) E regulation. BALB/c mice were exposed to a 3-week course of inhaled DEP exposure while undergoing intranasal sensitization to A. fumigatus. Purified DNA from splenic CD4(+) cells underwent bisulfite treatment, PCR amplification, and pyrosequencing. Sera IgE levels were compared with methylation levels at several CpG sites in the IL-4 and IFN-gamma promoter. Total IgE production was increased following intranasal sensitization A. fumigatus. IgE production was augmented further following combined exposure to A. fumigatus and DEP exposure. Inhaled DEP exposure and intranasal A. fumigatus induced hypermethylation at CpG(-45), CpG(-53), CpG(-205) sites of the IFN-gamma promoter and hypomethylation at CpG(-408) of the IL-4 promoter. Altered methylation of promoters of both genes was correlated significantly with changes in IgE levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that inhaled environmental exposures influence methylation of Th genes in vivo, supporting a new paradigm in asthma pathogenesis.

Exposure to dust mite allergen and endotoxin in early life and asthma and atopy in childhood	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						endotoxin; dust mite; wheeze; atopy; asthma	DAY-CARE ATTENDANCE; HOUSE-DUST; 1ST YEAR; LIMULUS ASSAY; P-I; CHILDREN; WHEEZE; RISK; HISTORY; INFANCY	Background: There has been no longitudinal study of the relation between concurrent exposure to dust mite allergen and endotoxin in early life and asthma and atopy at school age. Objectives: To examine the relation between exposure to dust mite allergen and endotoxin at age 2 to 3 months and asthma, wheeze, and atopy in high-risk children. Methods: Birth cohort study of 440 children with parental history of atopy in the Boston metropolitan area. Results: In multivariate analyses, early exposure to high levels of dust mite allergen (>= 10 mu g/g) was associated with increased risks of asthma at age 7 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9) and late-onset wheeze (OR, 5.0; 95% Cl, 1.5-16.4). Exposure to endotoxin levels above the lowest quartile at age 2 to 3 months was associated with reduced odds of atopy at school age (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). In contrast with its inverse association with atopy, endotoxin exposure in early life was associated with an increased risk of any wheeze between ages I and 7 years that did not change significantly with time (hazard ratio for each quartile increment in endotoxin levels, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43). Conclusion: Among children at risk of atopy, early exposure to high levels of dust mite allergen is associated with increased risks of asthma and late-onset wheeze. In these children, endotoxin exposure is associated with a reduced risk of atopy but an increased risk of wheeze. Clinical implications: Early endotoxin exposure may be a protective factor against atopy but a risk factor for wheeze in high-risk children.

World Trade Center "sarcoid-like" granulomatous pulmonary disease in New York city fire department rescue workers	CHEST			English	Article						airway hyperreactivity; asthma; emergency medical services workers; firefighters; granulomatous pneumonitis; sarcoidosis; World Trade Center	BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY; AIRWAY HYPERREACTIVITY; CENTER COLLAPSE; RISK-FACTORS; CENTER SITE; FIREFIGHTERS; EXPOSURE; PNEUMONITIS; ASSOCIATION; INVOLVEMENT	Background: Previous reports suggest that sarcoidosis occurs with abnormally high frequency in firefighters. We sought to determine whether exposure to World Trade Center (WTC) "dust" during the collapse and rescue/recovery effort increased the incidence of sarcoidosis or "sarcoid-like" granulomatous pulmonary disease (SLGPD). Methods: During the 5 years after the WTC disaster, enrollees in the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) WTC monitoring and treatment programs who had chest radiograph findings suggestive of sarcoidosis underwent evaluation, including the following: chest CT imaging, pulmonary function, provocative challenge, and biopsy. Annual incidence rates were compared to the 15 years before the WTC disaster. Results: After WTC dust exposure, pathologic evidence consistent with new-onset sarcoidosis was found in 26 patients: all 26 patients had intrathoracic adenopathy, and 6 patients (23%) had extrathoracic disease. Thirteen patients were identified during the first year after WTC dust exposure (incidence rate, 86/100,000), and 13 patients were identified during the next 4 years (average annual incidence rate, 22/100,000; as compared to 15/100,000 during the 15 years before the WTC disaster). Eighteen of 26 patients (69%) had findings consistent with asthma. Eight of 21 patients (38%) agreeing to challenge testing had airway hyperreactivity (AHR), findings not seen in FDNY sarcoidosis patients before the WTC disaster. Conclusion: After the WTC disaster, the incidence of sarcoidosis or SLGPD was increased among FDNY rescue workers. This new information about the early onset of WTC-SLGPD and its association with asthma/AHR has important public health consequences for disease prevention, early detection, and treatment following environmental/occupational exposures.

Objective: We sought to investigate the previously reported association between a polymorphism in the promoter region of CD14 (CD14/-260C -> T) and serum IgE levels in relation to the environment to which children are exposed. Methods: In 624 children living in 2 rural communities in Europe, we compared total and specific serum IgE levels between the genotypes of CD14/-260 in relation to exposure to animals and in relation to house dust endotoxin. Results: We found that the C allele of CD14/-260 was associated with higher levels of both total and specific serum IgE to aeroallergens in children with regular contact with pets, whereas an association in the opposite direction was found in children with regular contact with stable animals. This modifying effect of animal exposure was not explained by levels of house dust endotoxin. However, in children with high levels of house dust endotoxin, the C allele was associated with less specific IgE, independently from animal exposure. Conclusion: Because CD14 is a pattern recognition receptor for microbial molecules, the results suggest that the type and concentrations of such molecules present in the environment strongly determine the direction of the association between CD14/-260 and serum markers of atopy.

We have observed sustained airway hyperreactivity and airway remodeling occurring in mice after chronic allergen exposure and persisting beyond resolution of allergen-induced inflammation. The aim of this study was to delineate mechanisms involved in allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity and airway remodeling and to examine evidence for a causal association between airway remodeling and sustained airway hyperreactivity. Wild-type (WT) and interleukin (IL)-4-, IL-5-, and IL-13-deficient (-/-) mice were sensitized and studied 4 weeks after chronic allergen exposure. By measuring airway responsiveness and airway morphometry, we demonstrated that WT mice developed sustained airway hyperreactivity and aspects of airway remodeling after chronic allergen exposure. Both IL-4(-/-) and IL-13(-/-) mice were protected from developing sustained airway hyperreactivity and aspects of airway remodeling. In contrast, IL-5(-/-) mice developed sustained airway hyperreactivity and aspects of airway remodeling similar to that seen in WT mice. Our results confirm that IL-4 and IL-13, but not IL-5, are critical for the development of sustained airway hyperreactivity and airway remodeling after allergen exposure.

This paper reviews sources of, and health risks associated with, various indoor chemical pollutants, from a historical and global perspective. Health effects are presented for individual compounds or pollutant mixtures based on real-world exposure situations. Health risks from indoor air pollution are likely to be greatest in cities in developing countries, especially where risks associated with solid fuel combustion coincide with risk associated with modern buildings. Everyday exposure to multiple chemicals, most of which are present indoors, may contribute to increasing prevalence of asthma, autism, childhood cancer, medically unexplained symptoms, and perhaps other illnesses. Given that tobacco consumption and synthetic chemical usage will not be declining at least in the near future, concerns about indoor air pollution may be expected to remain.

IgE antibodies against these carbohydrate structures are induced upon exposure to pollen or after insect stings, and result in extensive cross-reactivity to plant and invertebrate foods. These cross-reactive IgE antibodies have been shown to possess variable degrees of biological activity, but have never been convincingly shown to induce clinical food allergy. The most likely explanation for this lack of clinical relevance has to be sought in a combination of epitope valency and antibody affinity. In diagnostic tests, these antibodies are at the basis of many false-positive test results for food allergy. Recombinant technologies offer the possibility to produce allergens that do not carry IgE-binding glycans. Whether their absence or presence is of importance for the application of recombinant allergens in immunotherapy is still largely unknown. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Genotypes for GSTM1 and GSTT1 and GSTP1 codon 105variants (ile105 and val105)were determined using DNA from buccal cell specimens. We used two-level regression models to estimate the effects of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes on the adjusted annual average lung function growth. GSTM1 null was associated with deficits in annual growth rates for FVC (-0.21%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], -0.40, 0.03) and FEV1, (-0.27%; 95% Cl, -0.50, -0.04). Children who were homozygous for the GSTP1 val105 allele had slower lung function growth (FVC -0.35%; 95% Cl, -0.62, -0.07; and FEV1 -0.34%; 95% Cl, -0.68, 0.00) than children with one or more ile105 alleles. Children with asthma who were homozygous for the GSTP1 val105 allele had substantially larger deficits in FVC, IFEVI, and maximal mid-expiratory flow than children without asthma. The deficits in FVC and FEV1 growth associated with both GSTM1 null and the GSTP1 val105 allele were largest and were statistically significant in non-Hispanic white children. We conclude that GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes are associated with lung function growth in school children.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Nationally representative survey of participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (from 1988 to 1994). Participants. Five hundred twenty-three children with physician-diagnosed asthma. Measurements and results: We stratified the study participants into tertiles on the basis of serum levels of cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine that indicates tobacco smoke exposure). We used logistic and linear regression modeling, adjusting for known covariates, to determine the effect of high environmental tobacco smoke exposure on the following outcomes: asthma severity (determined using reported symptom and respiratory illness frequency); lung function; physician P visits; and school absence. Among our study sample, 78.6% of children had mild asthma, 6.8% of children bad moderate asthma, and 14.6% of children had severe asthma. Asthmatic children with high levels of smoke exposure, compared with those with low levels of exposure, were more likely to have moderate or severe asthma (odds ratio, 2.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 6.8) and decreased lung function, with a mean FEV1 decrement of 213 mL or 8.1% (95% CI, -14.7 to - 3.5). Conclusions: Involuntary smoke exposure is associated with increased asthma severity and worsened lung function in a nationally representative group of US children with asthma.

We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and pneumonia in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994. We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed persons to having a greater risk from air pollution. We also considered effect modification by age, sex, and race. We found that the air-pollution-associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections. The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders. For COPD and pneumonia admissions, diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10)-associated admissions. Persons with asthma had twice the risk of a PM10-associated pneumonia admission and persons with heart failure had twice the risk of PM10-induced COPD admissions. The PM10 effect did not vary by sex, age, and race. These results suggest that patients with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects.

Objective: Our purpose was to examine whether the rate of apoptosis differs between peripheral blood eosinophils from asthmatic patients and healthy volunteers, Methods: Peripheral blood was obtained from volunteers with asthma and from control volunteers. Eosinophils were isolated by CD16-negative selection to >99% purity and were cultured for 48 hours, The number of apoptotic eosinophils in the culture was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of relative DNA content in propidium iodide-stained cells. Eosinophil apoptosis is expressed as apoptosis index (number of apoptotic cells/total number of cells). Results: Eosinophils From asthmatic patients not taking steroid medication survived longer (apoptosis index 0.25) than those of healthy control subjects (apoptosis index 0.40, P < .05). In contrast, the rate of apoptosis in eosinophils from patients concurrently taking steroids (apoptosis index 0.46) is higher than that of those not using steroids (P < .01) and not different from that of healthy subjects. To assess whether endogenous IL-3, IL-5, and CM-CSF production contributes to the delayed eosinophil apoptosis, the effects of the corresponding neutralizing antibodies were studied on eosinophil longevity. Neutralization of GM-CSF, but not of IL-3 or IL-5, increased slightly but significantly (P < .01) the rate of apoptosis in eosinophils obtained from patients with asthma, To assess whether beta(2)-agonist medication could contribute to the observed differences, we determined the in vitro effects of albuterol, Fenoterol, and salmeterol on eosinophil apoptosis, All beta(2)-agonists inhibited eosinophil apoptosis by 12% to 19%, A possibility existed that a prior in vivo exposure to IL-5, GM-CSF, or beta(2)-agonists would explain the observed difference. To study this, eosinophils were incubated with GM-CSF, IL-5, and albuterol for 2 to 3 hours, followed by washout of the added compounds, and were subsequently cultured for 48 hours. However, an exposure to GM-CSF (7 pmol/L) or IL-5 (10 pmol/L) for 15 to 180 minutes was not a sufficient signal to prevent eosinophil apoptosis, In contrast, exposure to albuterol (100 nmol/L) for 120 minutes was sufficient to induce a significant (P < .05) decrease in eosinophil apoptosis, Conclusions: The results suggest that eosinophil apoptosis is delayed in asthma, This delay may be partly explained by production of GM-CSF, The in vitro effects of beta(2)-agonists suggest that beta(2)-agonist use might contribute to the prolonged eosinophil survival through inhibition of apoptosis and thus may worsen eosinophilia in asthmatic patients, Use of inhaled glucocorticoids seems to totally reverse the delayed eosinophil apoptosis in asthma.

We hypothesized that weakening of the physical barrier in FLG-deficient individuals may potentiate the effect of environmental exposures. Therefore, we investigated whether there is an interaction between FLG loss-of-function mutations with environmental exposures ( pets and dust mites) in relation to the development of eczema. Methods and Findings We used data obtained in early life in a high-risk birth cohort in Denmark and replicated the findings in an unselected birth cohort in the United Kingdom. Primary outcome was age of onset of eczema; environmental exposures included pet ownership and mite and pet allergen levels. In Copenhagen (n = 379), FLG mutation increased the risk of eczema during the first year of life ( hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-4.00, p = 0.005), with a further increase in risk related to cat exposure at birth amongst children with FLG mutation (HR 11.11, 95% CI 3.79-32.60, p < 0.0001); dog exposure was moderately protective (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-1.01, p = 0.05), but not related to FLG genotype. In Manchester ( n 503) an independent and significant association of the development of eczema by age 12 mo with FLG genotype was confirmed (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13-3.36, p = 0.02). In addition, the risk increased because of the interaction of cat ownership at birth and FLG genotype (HR 3.82, 95% CI 1.35-10.81, p = 0.01), with no significant effect of the interaction with dog ownership (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16-2.20, p = 0.43). Mite-allergen had no effects in either cohort. The observed effects were independent of sensitisation. Conclusions We have demonstrated a significant interaction between FLG loss-of-function main mutations (501x and 2282del4) and cat ownership at birth on the development of early-life eczema in two independent birth cohorts. Our data suggest that cat but not dog ownership substantially increases the risk of eczema within the first year of life in children with FLG loss-of-function variants, but not amongst those without. FLG-deficient individuals may need to avoid cats but not dogs in early life.

Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) plays an important part in regulating these three arms of the immune response by limiting the T(H)1 response and promoting the T(H)2 and T(H)17 responses. In this study, we investigated pathways in DCs that promote IL-6 production. We show that the allergen house dust mite ( HDM) or the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin promotes cell surface expression of c-Kit and its ligand, stem cell factor ( SCF), on DCs. This dual upregulation of c-Kit and SCF results in sustained signaling downstream of c-Kit, promoting IL-6 secretion. Intranasal administration of antigen into c-Kit-mutant mice or neutralization of IL-6 in cultures established from the lung-draining lymph nodes of immunized wild-type mice blunted the T(H)2 and T(H)17 responses. DCs lacking functional c-Kit or those unable to express membrane-bound SCF secreted lower amounts of IL- 6 in response to HDM or cholera toxin. DCs expressing nonfunctional c-Kit were unable to induce a robust T(H)2 or T(H)17 response and elicited diminished allergic airway inflammation when adoptively transferred into mice. Expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-2, which has been associated with T(H)2 differentiation, was blunted in DCs from c-Kit-mutant mice. c-Kit upregulation was specifically induced by T(H)2- and T(H)17-skewing stimuli, as the T(H)1-inducing adjuvant, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, did not promote either c-Kit or Jagged-2 expression. DCs generated from mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of the p110 delta subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 ( PI3) kinase ( p110(D910A)) secreted lower amounts of IL-6 upon stimulation with cholera toxin. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of the c-Kit-PI3 kinase-IL-6 signaling axis in DCs in regulating T cell responses.

Aim To better understand the ARIA classification of rhinitis. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in 591 patients consulting ENT or allergy specialists for AR and 502 control subjects. The diagnosis of AR was based on a score for allergic rhinitis (SFAR) >= 7. Patients were classified according to the four ARIA classes ( mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate/severe intermittent and moderate/severe persistent). Allergen sensitization (skin prick tests (SPTs) or specific IgE) and co- morbidities were examined according to the ARIA classes. Results Ten percent of patients had mild intermittent rhinitis, 14% mild persistent rhinitis, 17% moderate/severe intermittent rhinitis and 59% moderate/severe persistent rhinitis. Most patients with intermittent rhinitis had a pollen sensitivity, but 5% had a single house dust mite (HDM) sensitization. Over 50% of patients with persistent rhinitis were allergic to pollens or HDM. Asthma was present in 24% of rhinitis patients and in only 2% of the control population ( P < 0.0001). Patients with moderate/severe persistent rhinitis had the highest asthma prevalence (33%). Discussion Intermittent and persistent rhinitis are not synonymous of seasonal and perennial rhinitis. Most patients consulting specialists have severe rhinitis. Asthma prevalence increases with duration and severity of rhinitis supporting the ARIA major recommendation that patients with persistent rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma.

This review describes the currently available epidemiological literature on health effects of (1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucan, focusing on atopy, airway inflammation and symptoms, asthma, and lung function. In addition to population studies, studies in human volunteers experimentally exposed to (1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucan are described as well as relevant animal studies. Furthermore, the review discusses exposure assessment methods, the potential for exposure control and it concludes with identifying research needs. The observational and experimental studies reviewed suggested some association between (1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucan exposure, airway inflammation and symptoms, however, results were mixed and specific symptoms and potential underlying inflammatory mechanisms associated with exposure could not be identified. Large observational studies using well validated exposure assessment methods are needed to further our knowledge regarding the potential health effects of indoor (1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucan exposure.

HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; POPULATION-SAMPLE; SMOKE-INHALATION; SYNDROME RADS; LUNG-FUNCTION; EXPOSURE	New York City Fire Department rescue workers experienced massive exposure to airborne particulates at the World Trade Center site. Aims of this longitudinal study were to (1) determine if bronchial hyperreactivity was present, persistent, and independently associated with exposure intensity, (2) identify objective measures shortly after the collapse that would predict persistent hyperreactivity and a diagnosis of reactive airways dysfunction 6 months post-collapse. A representative sample of 179 rescue workers stratified by exposure intensity (high, moderate, and control) without current smoking or prior respiratory disease was enrolled. Highly exposed workers arrived within 2 hours of collapse, moderately exposed workers arrived later on Days 1-2; control subjects were not exposed. Hyperreactivity at 1, 3, and 6 months post-collapse was associated with exposure intensity, independent of ex-smoking and airflow obstruction. Six months post-collapse, highly exposed workers were 6.8 times more likely than moderately exposed workers and control subjects to be hyperreactive (95% confidence interval, 1.8-25.2; p = 0.004), and hyperreactivity persisted in 55% of those hyperreactive at I and/or 3 months. In highly exposed subjects, hyperreactivity 1 or 3 months post-collapse was the sole predictor for reactive airways dysfunction (p = 0.021). In conclusion, development and persistence of hyperreactivity and reactive airways dysfunction were strongly and independently associated with exposure intensity. Hyperreactivity shortly post-collapse predicted reactive airways dysfunction at 6 months in highly exposed workers; this has important implications for disaster management.

The persistence of airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and asthma in this population is not known, however, inasmuch as follow-up studies of athletes' asthma have not been performed. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate effect of finishing high-level sports on airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and asthma. Methods: Forty-two elite competitive swimmers, most of them from the Finnish national team (37/42; 88%), were followed for 5 years in a prospective manner. All of the swimmers completed questionnaires and underwent resting spirometry, histamine challenge testing, and skin prick tests at baseline and at follow-up. Twenty-nine swimmers (69%) also gave induced sputum samples on both occasions. Sixteen (38%) of the swimmers had continued their competitive careers during follow-up (active swimmers), but 26 (62%) had stopped competing more than 3 months before the follow-up examination (past swimmers). Results: Bronchial responsiveness was increased in 7 (44%) of the 16 active swimmers at baseline and in 8 (50%) of the 16 active swimmers at follow-up; it was increased in 8 (31%) of the 26 past swimmers at baseline and in 3 (12%) of the 26 past swimmers at follow-up (McNemar test, P = .025). The difference in the change in bronchial hyperresponsiveness between the study groups was significant (likelihood ratio test, P = .023). Current asthma (defined as bronchial hyperresponsiveness and exercise-induced bronchial symptoms monthly) was observed in 5 (31%) of the active swimmers at baseline and in 7 (44%) of the active swimmers at follow-up; of the past swimmers, it occurred in 6 (23%) at baseline and in 1 (4%) at follow-up (McNemar test, P = .025). The difference in the change in current asthma between the study groups was significant (likelihood ratio test, P = .0040). The sputum differential cell counts of eosinophils and lymphocytes increased significantly during the follow-up period in the active swimmers (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test; P = .033 and P = .0029, respectively); in the past swimmers, the sputum differential cell counts of eosinophils tended to decrease during the follow-up period (P = .17), whereas the differential cell counts of lymphocytes did not change significantly. The changes in the sputum differential cell counts of eosinophils between the study groups differed significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, P = .019). Conclusion: In swimmers who had stopped high-level training, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma attenuated or even disappeared. Mild eosinophilic airway inflammation was aggravated among highly trained swimmers who remained active during the 5-year follow-up. Our results suggest that athletes' asthma is partly reversible and that it may develop during and subside after an active sports career.

Objective: To compare health care use and costs among children with ADHD, children with asthma, and the general pediatric population. Design and Setting: The 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative household survey. Participants: All 5439 children aged 5 to 20 years from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were included in this analysis. Children who had ADHD, asthma,d or neither (general population) were identified from Into-national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes and prescription records. Main Outcome Measures: Mean health care use (outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospital stays, home health visit days, and prescriptions) and associated expenditures. Results: We identified 105 children with ADHD, 322 with asthma, and 4052 with neither diagnosis. Children with ADHD had significantly higher mean total health care costs ($1151) compared with children with asthma ($1091 P<.05) and the general population ($712 P<.001). After adjusting for age, Sex, race, household income, access to care, parent education, and martial Status, excess total costs were $479 for children with ADHD (P<.001) and $437 for children with asthma (P<.01). Conclusions: Overall costs of care for children with ADHD are comparable to costs for children with asthma and significantly greater than for the general pediatric Population, Specific types of health care use and the sources of expenditures differ between children with ADHD and children with asthma. Because much ADHD-related care occurs within school and mental health settings, these figures likely underestimate the true costs of caring for children with this condition.

We assessed variations in home concentrations of dust Mite, cock-roach, cat, and dog allergens in dust collected in the main living areas of asthmatics' homes by family income, mother's education, dwelling type, population density, household population density, and ethnicity in Connecticut and south-central Massachusetts. Dust samples were collected at the time of home interview in 999 homes as part of an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study of 1,002 infants and their asthmatic siblings. The analysis employed lower arid upper cut points for group 1 dust mite (greater than or equal to2.0 mug/g and greater than or equal to10 mug/g), cockroach (greater than or equal to1.0 U/g and greater than or equal to4.0 U/g), cat (greater than or equal to1.0 mug/g and greater than or equal to8.0 ug/g), and dog (greater than or equal to2.0 mug/g and 10.0 mug/g) allergens. Subject residences were geocoded to assess population density from the U.S. Census, and multiple logistic regression was used to control for confounding, The portion of homes at the lower cut point for dust mite, cockroach, cat, and dog allergens were 46.9%, 24.9%, 42.2%, and 35.6%, respectively; the upper cut point for each of the allergens was reached in 22.4%, 13.4%, 21.0%, and 22.9% of the homes, respectively. In all, 86.0% of the homes had at least one allergen at the lower cut point, and 58.0% had at least one allergen at the upper cut point. Forty-nine percent of the homes had two or more allergens at the lower cut point, and 19.7% had two or more allergens at the upper cut point. Higher education of the mother, higher household income, living in a single-family home in a less densely populated area with fewer people per room, and being a white household were associated with elevated dust mite, cat, and dog allergens and low cockroach allergen. In contrast, low income, living in a multifamily home in a high population density area with a higher occupancy rate per room, and being a Hispanic or black household were associated with elevated cockroach allergens and low concentrations of dust mite, cat, and dog allergens. Although the presence of an individual allergen is more likely associated with one or more socioeconomic or ethnic factors, most homes typically have multiple allergen burdens in excess of concentrations thought to be associated with sensitization and exacerbation of asthma.

Objectives: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the evidence of the effect of exposure to pets in the home on the risk of asthma and asthma-related symptoms. We also assessed differences between the studies as sources of heterogeneity of the results. Methods: We conducted a MEDLINE search (until the end of 1999) using the following boolean search command: (asthma[all] OR wheez*[all]) AND (domestic animal*[all] OR pets[all]). The outcome was limited to either diagnosis of asthma or the symptom of wheezing, The exposure of interest was domestic animals in the home, Appropriate temporal relationship was defined as present in studies with either pet keeping within the first 2 years of life, in the past, or exposure to pets preceding the outcome. Results: Thirty-two of the 217 retrieved articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Inappropriate time sequence of the exposure and outcome information was an important source of heterogeneity and an indication of potential selection bias. Therefore we analyzed studies focusing on early exposure or ensuring appropriate temporal sequence. The pooled risk estimates for both asthma (fixed-effects odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.98-1.25; heterogeneity, P = .04; random-effects odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.89-1.34) and wheezing (fixed-effects odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35; heterogeneity, P = .03; random-effects odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.95-1.44) indicated a small effect, which was limited to studies with a median study population age of over 6 years (fixed-effects odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.40; heterogeneity, P = .04; random-effects odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.86-1.56; fixed-effects odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48; heterogeneity, P = .31). In younger children the harmful effect disappeared for wheezing (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.59-1.08; P = .38). Conclusion: Exposure to pets appears to increase the risk of asthma and wheezing in older children. The observed lower risk among exposed than among unexposed young children is consistent with a protective effect in this age, group but could also be explained by selection bias.

Design: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey, including questionnaire information, measurements of serum cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine), and pulmonary function measurement, of 5400 US children. Setting and Participants: Children aged 4 to 16 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, October 25, 1988, to October 15, 1994. Methods: We stratified the study participants into tertiles, on the basis of serum cotinine levels, and used logistic and linear regression modeling, adjusting for known covariates, to determine the effect of high environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure (on the basis of a high cotinine level) on outcomes such as the prevalence of current asthma, the prevalence of frequent wheezing, school absence, and lung function. For children aged 4 to 11 years, we also determined the effect of prenatal maternal smoking on these outcomes. Results: We observed effects of ETS exposure in all age groups, although the effects varied between age groups. Among all children significant effects associated with high cotinine levels were for wheezing apart from cold in the past year (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8); 6 or more days of school absence in the past year (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8); and lung function decrements in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean change, -1.8%; 95% CI, -3.2% to -0.4%) and the maximal midexpiratory flow (mean change, -5.9%; 95% CI, -8.1% to -3.4%). Although current and ever asthma were not significantly associated with high cotinine levels in the overall group (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-2.7, and OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2, respectively), they were increased significantly among 4- to 6-year-old children (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.2-12.7, and OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1, respectively). Conclusions: We investigated recent ETS exposures as important predictors of respiratory health outcomes in children 4 years and older. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure affects children of all ages, although the exact effects may vary between age groups.

Animal models mimicking as closely as possible the allergic features observed in human asthma are therefore interesting tools for studying the immunological and pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Especially the role of eosinophils and allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E in the pathophysiology of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) remains a subject of intense debate. Objective To develop a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness based on the use of purified house dust mite allergen (Der p 1) as clinical relevant allergen. Furthermore, we studied the effects of low dose allergen exposure on the airway eosinophilia and AHR. Methods On day 0, C57B1/6 mice were immunized with purified Der p 1 intraperitoneally. From day 14-20, the mice were exposed daily to a 30-min aerosol of different concentrations of house dust mite extract. Results Mice, actively immunized with Der p 1 and subsequently exposed to HDM aerosols, developed AHR, eosinophil infiltration of the airways and allergen-specific IgE. Moreover, lowering the concentration of the HDM aerosol also induced AHR and IgE without apparent eosinophil influx into the airways. Der p 1-sensitized mice exposed to PBS produced IgE, but did not show AHR or eosinophil influx. Conclusion This in vivo model of HDM-induced allergic airway changes suggests that AHR is not related to either eosinophil influx or allergen-specific serum IgE, thereby reducing the importance of these factors as essential elements for allergic AHR.

Dendritic cells have a pivotal role in the activation of T helper (Th) 2 cells and allergic inflammation. Lung dendritic cells can also prevent harmful immune responses to innocuous inhaled antigens via induction of regulatory T cells or Th1 cells. In our Review, we discuss how understanding the biology of dendritic cells is crucial for understanding the interaction between allergens, the environment, and genetics, and focus on how dendritic cells conspire with airway epithelial cells and innate pro-Th2 cells to cause allergic sensitisation and asthma.

ATOPIC ECZEMA; YOUNG-ADULTS; HAY-FEVER	Skin prick testing (SPT) is the standard method for diagnosing allergic sensitization but is to some extent performed differently in clinical centres across Europe. There would be advantages in harmonizing the standard panels of allergens used in different European countries, both for clinical purposes and for research, especially with increasing mobility within Europe and current trends in botany and agriculture. As well as improving diagnostic accuracy, this would allow better comparison of research findings in European allergy centres. We have compared the different SPT procedures operating in 29 allergy centres within the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2)LEN). Standard SPT is performed similarly in all centres, e.g. using commercial extracts, evaluation after 15-20 min exposure with positive results defined as a wheal > 3 mm diameter. The perennial allergens included in the standard SPT panel of inhalant allergens are largely similar (e.g. cat: pricked in all centres; dog: 26 of 29 centres and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus: 28 of 29 centres) but the choice of pollen allergens vary considerably, reflecting different exposure and sensitization rates for regional inhalant allergens.

However, people spend most of their time indoors exposed to a combination of indoor-generated particles and ambient particles that have infiltrated. Thus, it is important to investigate the differential health effects of indoor- and ambient-generated particles. We combined our recently adapted recursive model and a predictive model for estimating infiltration efficiency to separate personal exposure (L) to PM2.5 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 pm) into its indoor-generated (E-ig) and ambient-generated (E-ag) components for 19 children with asthma. We then compared E-ig and E-ag to changes in exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), a marker of airway inflammation. Based on the recursive model with a sample size of eight children, E-ag was marginally associated with increases in eNO [5.6 ppb per 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.6 to 11.9; p = 0.08]. E-ig was not associated with eNO (-0.19 ppb change per 10 mu g/m(3)). Our predictive model allowed us to estimate E-ag and E-ig for all 19 children. For those combined estimates, only E-ag was significantly associated with an increase in eNO (E-ag: 5.0 ppb per 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; p = 0.04; E-ig: 3.3 ppb per 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, -1.1 to 7.7; p = 0.15). Effects were seen only in children who were not using corticosteroid therapy. We conclude that the ambient-generated component of PM2.5 exposure is consistently associated with increases in eNO, and the indoor-generated component is less strongly associated with eNO.

Although for most immediate reactions an allergic hypersensitivity cannot be demonstrated, recent studies indicate that the severe immediate reactions may be IgE-mediated, while most of the nonimmediate exanthematous skin reactions, appear to be T-cell mediated. Patients who experience such hypersensitivity reactions are therefore advised to undergo an allergologic evaluation. Several investigators have found skin testing to be useful in confirming a CM allergy, especially in patients with nonimmediate skin eruptions. If a patient with confirmed allergy to a CM needs a new CM exposure, a skin test negative CM should be chosen and premedication may be tried. However, none of these precautional measures is a guarantee against a repeat reaction. More research focusing on pathomechanisms, diagnostic testing and premedication is therefore clearly needed in order to prevent CM-induced hypersensitivity reactions in the future.

Preexisting immunologic factors may influence the expression of viral infections in infancy, and in turn, recurrent infections may influence the development of immune responses. A total of 285 children were enrolled in the Childhood Origins of Asthma Project at birth and followed for at least 1 year. Cord blood and 1-year mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, and cytokine-response profiles were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nasal lavage was performed for moderate to severe respiratory illnesses. Daycare attendance and/or siblings significantly increased the likelihood of contracting respiratory syncytial virus (1.5-1.6-fold increase) and rhinovirus (1.8-2.1-fold increase), and increased the risk of rhinovirus-induced wheezing (14-18% vs. 2%, p = 0.011). Cord blood IFN-gamma responses were inversely related to the frequency of viral respiratory infections (r(s) = -0.11, p = 0.05), and more significant for subjects with high exposure to other children (r(s) = -0.27, p = 0.028). The interval change in infantile IFN-gamma responses correlated positively with the frequency of viral infections in infancy (r(s) = 0.12, p = 0.047). These data suggest that neonatal IFN-gamma responses may influence antiviral activity, or may represent a marker of antiviral immunity maturation. Conversely, the frequency of viral infections in infancy can influence IFN-gamma responses.

The current study determined whether severe airflow obstruction is related to inflammatory or structural changes in the airways. Patients with severe asthma from a tertiary referral clinic were divided into two groups according to their postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1): severe persistent airflow limitation (FEV1 <50% predicted; group S; n=37) and no obstruction (FEV1 >80% pred; group N; n=29). Smoking history, atopic status, lung function tests, exhaled NO, blood eosinophil count, quality of life scores using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs were assessed. Patients from group S were older and had longer disease duration. There was no difference in smoking history, atopic status, hospital admissions, quality of life scores and amount of treatment with inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Exhaled NO and peripheral blood eosinophils were higher in group S (21.0+/-2.4 versus 12.8+/-2.3 ppb; 0.41+/-0.06 versus 0.15+/-0.03x10(9)cells(.)L(-1), respectively). HRCT scores for bronchial wall thickening and dilatation were higher in group S with no differences in air trapping. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and bronchial wall thickening on HRCT scan were the only parameters significantly and independently associated with persistent airflow obstruction. Patients with severe asthma and irreversible airflow obstruction had longer disease duration, a greater inflammatory process and more high resolution computed tomography airway abnormalities suggestive of airway remodelling, despite being on similar treatments and experiencing equivalent impairment in quality of life.

Histologic analysis of tissues from A/J mice revealed features typical of airway remodeling, i.e., airway wall thickening and increased Collagen depositions were observed after 12 weeks' antigen exposure. Persistent airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was observed in chronically antigen-exposed A/J mice. Eosinophilic inflammation, Collagen deposition, and airway wall thickening were all less marked in BALB/c mice than in A/J mice, and no AHR was observed in the former strain. In C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice, eosinophilic inflammation, airway wall thickening, and AHR were not observed at all, although slightly increase Collagen deposition was observed. Thus, we found that these changes were strain-dependent. On the other hand, in A/J mice inhalational antigen challenge after ovalbumin/alum immunization led only to a transient increase in eosinophils and to less airway wall thickening, indicating the importance of the protocol used. Use of A/J mice and giving antigen by instillation via the nose is to be recommended for studies of the mechanisms underlying asthma. In particular, useful qualitative and quantitative information relating to the structural and histologic changes in the lungs may be obtainable using this model.

Objective To test the performance of this allergen microarray in a serological analytical study. Methods Standard allergens contained in grass pollen (Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5 and Phl p 6) and tree pollen ( Bet v 1 and Bet v 2) were used as a model system. The detection of allergen-specific serum IgE using microarrays was compared with standard test systems: CAP/RAST and an in-house ELISA. In order to test the analytical sensitivity of the assays, geometric dilutions of a serum pool containing high levels of pollen-specific IgE from allergic individuals were tested in each system. To assess the analytical specificity, the sera of 51 patients with presumptive allergic symptoms were collected before diagnosis. Thereafter, the results for grass/tree-pollen-specific IgE were compared. Results The microarray has a good dynamic range similar to the CAP/RAST system. Microarray and ELISA showed comparable analytical sensitivity exceeding the CAP/RAST system. With respect to the analytical specificity, no significant cross-reactivity of the allergens was observed. For two of the allergens tested, weak positive signals were detected in the microarray test system, whereas they were not detectable by CAP/ RAST. Conclusion A good correlation of presently used methods to detect serum IgE and the novel microarray test system was observed. As a next step, a careful validation of this method for a multitude of allergens and a thorough clinical evaluation has to be provided. Microarray testing of allergen-specific IgE can be presumed to be the method of choice for a prospective component-resolved diagnosis of Type I allergy, and the basis for the design and monitoring of a patient-tailored specific immunotherapy in the future.

Methods: A birth cohort of 4089 infants was followed prospectively in Stockholm, Sweden. Information about various exposures was obtained by parental questionnaires when the infants were 2 months old, and about allergic symptoms and feeding at 1 and 2 years of age. Duration of exclusive and partial breast feeding was assessed separately. Symptom related definitions of various allergic diseases were used. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in a multiple logistic regression model. Adjustments were made for potential confounders. Results: Children exclusively breast fed during four months or more exhibited less asthma (7.7% v 12%, ORadj 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8), less atopic dermatitis (24% v 27%, ORadj = 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0), and less suspected allergic rhinitis (6.5% v 9%, ORadj = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0) by 2 years of age. There was a significant risk reduction for asthma related to partial breast feeding during six months or more (ORadj = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9). Three or more of five possible allergic disorders-asthma, suspected allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy related symptoms, and suspected allergic respiratory symptoms after exposure to pets or pollen-were found in 6.5% of the children. Exclusive breast feeding prevented children from having multiple allergic disease (ORadj = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9) during the first two years of life. Conclusion: Exclusive breast feeding seems to have a preventive effect on the early development of allergic disease-that is, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and suspected allergic rhinitis, up to 2 years of age. This protective effect was also evident for multiple allergic disease.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in fermented foods or belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were shown to exert beneficial effects on human health. Recent reports have indicated their capacity to reduce allergic symptoms. Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of LAB on the production of type 2 cytokines, which characterize allergic diseases. Methods: PBMCs from patients allergic to house dust mite versus those from healthy donors were stimulated for 48 hours with the related Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen or with a staphylococcal superantigen. The effect of LAB preincubation was assessed by measuring the type 2 cytokine production by means of specific ELISA. Results: The tested gram-positive LAB were shown to inhibit the secretion of T(H)2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5). This effect was dose dependent and was observed irrespective of the LAB strain used. No significant inhibition was induced by the control, gram-negative Escherichia coli TG1. Interestingly, LAB reduced the T(H)2 cytokine production from allergic PBMCs specifically restimulated with the related allergen. The inhibition mechanism was shown to be dependent on antigen-presenting cells (ie, monocytes) and on the involvement of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. Conclusion: The tested LAB strains were demonstrated to exhibit an anti-T(H)2 activity, and thus different, strains of this family might be useful in the prevention of allergic diseases.

Identifying high-risk children at an early age, however, is currently difficult. Objective: We sought to determine those factors present in early life that predict an increased risk of adult asthma. Methods: A prospective cohort study of subjects at risk of asthma and atopy was undertaken in Poole, England. One hundred babies of atopic parents were recruited at birth. During the first 5 years of life, subjects were recalled annually, all respiratory events were reported, and skin prick tests and total serum IgE measurements were performed. At 11 and 22 years, bronchial hyperresponsiveness was also measured. Seventy-three subjects were followed up at 5 years, 67 at 11 years, and 63 at 22 years. Results: Twenty-three (37%) adult subjects reported wheezing within the previous 12 months. Fifteen (25%) of these subjects showed signs of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and were regarded as asthmatic. Wheezing before the age of 2 years occurred in 28% and was not significantly related to adult asthma (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.03-1.7; P =.19). A positive skin prick test response to hen's egg, cow's milk, or both in the first year was independently predictive of adult asthma (odds ratio, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.1-55.1; P =.001; sensitivity, 57%; specificity, 89%).

We followed this cohort of genetically at-risk children to investigate the relationship between factors assessed in infancy and asthma, allergy, and psychological status at school age. Methods. A cohort of 150 children who were at risk for developing asthma were identified prenatally on the basis of the mothers' having asthma. For 28 children, the father had asthma as well, putting them at bilateral genetic risk. Families primarily were middle and upper middle class Caucasians. Parents came to the clinic during the third trimester of pregnancy for assessments of medical and psychosocial functioning. A home visit took place when the infant was 3 weeks old, when parenting risk was assessed before the onset of any asthma symptoms. Parenting difficulties included problems with infant caregiving as well as components of maternal functioning, such as postpartum depression and inadequate marital support. Blood was drawn for serum IgE at 6 months of age. Parents and offspring subsequently came to the clinic multiple times, with the last clinic visit during the child's sixth year. Follow-up at age 6 involved a clinic visit for allergy and psychosocial evaluations, consisting of interviews and a behavior questionnaire. Seventy-seven children received the allergy and psychosocial evaluation, 26 received the psychosocial evaluation in the clinic, and 30 families received telephone interviews and mailed in questionnaires. Additional monitoring of families by telephone and mail was maintained over the next 2 years, until the children were 8, to ensure accurate characterization of the course of illness. Comprehensive medical records were obtained and reviewed for all health care contacts. Children were designated as having asthma when there was documentation in medical records of physician-diagnosed asthma, observed wheezing, and/or prescription of asthma medications during the time period when the child was between 6 and 8 years of age. Parental reports of the occurrence of asthma corroborated the medical record data. Results. Data regarding asthma status were available for 145 children through 8 years of age. Forty (28%) of the children manifested asthma between 6 and 8 years of age. Among variables previously reported to predict asthma onset by age 3, 3 proved to have significant univariate relationships with asthma between ages 6 and 8: elevated IgE levels measured when the children were 6 months of age, global ratings of parenting difficulties measured when infants were 3 weeks old, and higher numbers of respiratory infections in the first year of life. Among these offspring of mothers with asthma, paternal asthma showed a significant association with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Eczema in the first year was not significantly related to later asthma. Multiple logistic regression showed that the model that best predicted asthma at ages 6 to 8 from infancy variables included 2 main effects. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-month IgE was 2.15 (1.51, 3.05) and for parenting difficulties was 2.07 (1.15, 3.71). Although socioeconomic status (SES) was not associated with asthma at ages 6 to 8, families of lower SES were more likely to be rated as having parenting difficulties early in the child's life. The mothers of lower SES breastfed for a shorter period of time and were more likely to smoke during their infant's first year. There were more respiratory infections during the first year of life among infants whose mother was rated as having more parenting difficulties. Mothers who reported smoking breastfed their infants for a shorter length of time. Male gender was significantly associated with higher IgE levels when infants were 6 months of age. Laboratory testing was completed for 77 children at age 6. Total serum IgE levels were significantly higher for the children with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Skin-prick testing showed that the children with asthma had significantly more positive skin test reactions than did the children without asthma. Psychosocial interview data at 6 years of age were available for 103 families, and behavioral questionnaires were available for 133 families. On the basis of 6-year interviews, children with asthma were rated as being at greater psychological risk than were the children without asthma. Mothers' Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings of their children's behavior indicated higher internalizing scores for the children with asthma as compared with the children without asthma. Like the 6-month IgE, 6-year IgE was higher for boys. IgE levels measured at 6 months of age were significantly correlated with 6-year IgE levels. Parenting difficulties measured at 3 weeks were significantly correlated with 6-year measures of maternal depression, CBCL Internalizing score, and Child Psychological Risk (CPR) score. There also were significant correlations among the psychosocial variables assessed when the children were 6 years of age; maternal depression was significantly associated with child CBCL Internalizing score and CPR score, and the last 2 also were significantly correlated. Multiple logistic regression showed that 2 concurrently measured variables entered the model showing the strongest associations with asthma at ages 6 to 8. The adjusted odds ratio for CPR score was 3.21 (1.29-7.96) and for 6-year IgE was 1.71 (1.04-2.80). Conclusions. This study of the natural history of childhood asthma focused on the development of asthma into the school-age years in a genetically at-risk group of children. The relationships between biological and psychosocial variables in the first year and school-age asthma support the formulation of asthma as beginning early in life, with the developing immune system interacting with environmental influences. The data provide support for the possible contribution of psychosocial factors to asthma onset and persistence into childhood.

As an immune switch toward Th1 can protect against Th2-mediated allergic response, this study investigated the capacity of lung macrophages to stimulate Th1 responses during the secondary exposure to inhaled allergen, thereby suppressing Th2-mediated allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma. Following airway macrophage depletion in OVA-sensitized mice, lung T cells defaulted to a phenotype that produced less Th1 (IFN-gamma) and more Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines, leading to more severe airway hyperreactivity and inflammation after intranasal Ag challenge. After OVA pulsing and adoptive transfer, lung macrophages selectively promoted a Th1 response in Ag-sensitized recipients and did not induce pulmonary eosinophilia. By contrast, OVA pulsing and adoptive transfer of a lung cell preparation, consisting of dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, promoted a Th2 response with an associated inflammatory response that was suppressed when macrophages were present and pretreated with IFN-gamma, but exacerbated when macrophages were depleted before IFN-gamma treatment. In addition, Th1-promoting activity of lung macrophages was not related to the autocrine production of IL-12p40. These results suggest that the Th1-promoting APC activity may be an inherent property of the lung macrophage population, and may play an important role, upon stimulation by IFN-gamma, in antagonizing an ongoing Th2 immunity and Th2-dependent allergic responses.

High-risk infants from four Danish centres were included in the period from June 1994 to July 1995. Five-hundred and ninety-five high-risk infants were identified. Nigh-risk infants were defined as having biparental atopy, or a single atopic first-degree relative combined with cord blood immunoglobulin E (IgE) greater than or equal to 0.3 kU/l, At birth all infants were randomized to one of three different blinded formulas. All mothers had unrestricted diets during pregnancy and lactation and were encouraged to breast-feed exclusively. If breastfeeding was insufficient, one of the three formulas, according to randomization, was given during the first 4 months. It was recommended not to introduce cow's milk, cow's milk products, and solid foods until the age of 4 months. After the age of 4 months a normal unrestricted diet and conventional cow's milk-based formula were given when needed. All infants were followed-up prospectively with interview and physical examination at the age of 6, 12, and 18 months, and if any possible atopic symptoms were reported. If food allergy was suspected, controlled elimination/challenge procedures were performed in a hospital setting. Of 550 infants included in the study, 514 were seen at all visits and 36 were excluded owing to noncompliance. Of 478 infants who completed the study, 232 were exclusively breast-fed, 79 received an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (Nutramigen), 82 an extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (Profylac), and 85 a partially hydrolyzed whey formula (Nan WA), during the first 4 months of life. These four groups were identical in regard to atopic predisposition, cord blood IgE, birthplace, and gender. Exclusively breastfed children were exposed less to tobacco smoke and pets at home and belonged to higher social classes, whereas the three formula groups were identical concerning environmental factors. The frequency of breast-feeding was high; only eight (2%) children were not breast-fed at all. The three formula groups were identical in regard to duration of breast-feeding: and age at introduction of formula and solid foods. No significant differences were found in the three groups of infants receiving formula milk regarding the cumulative incidence of atopic dermatitis or respiratory symptoms. The cumulative incidence of parental-reported cow's milk allergy was significantly higher in children fed partially hydrolyzed formula (Nan HA) compared with extensively hydrolyzed formula (Nutramigen or Profylac) at 12 and 18 months (NanHA, 7.1%; Nutramigen, 2.5%; Profylac, 0%; p = 0.033). The cumulative incidence of confirmed cow's milk allergy was 1.3% (three of 232) in exclusively breast-fed infants, 0.6% tone of 161) in infants fed extensively hydrolyzed formula (Nutramigen or Profylac), and 4.7% (four of 85) in infants fed partially hydrolyzed formula (Nan HA). Partially hydrolyzed formula was found to be less effective than extensively hydrolyzed formula in preventing cow's milk allergy, 0.6% vs. 4.7% (p = 0.05), but because of the small number of cases the results should be interpreted with caution. Compared with other similar studies the frequency of atopic symptoms was low, even though the dietetic intervention did not include either maternal diet during lactation or dietary restrictions to the children after the age of 3 months.

Generation of a bronchoconstrictor, LTC4, was similar in both AIA and ATA, Consequently, the ratio of LXA(4):LTC4 quantitatively favoured the bronchoconstrictor for AIA and differed from both ATA and healthy subjects. In addition, the capacity for 15-epi-LXA(4) generation was also diminished in AIA, since whole blood stimulated in the presence of aspirin gave increased levels only in samples from ATA, The present results indicate that asthmatics possess the capacity to generate both lipoxins and 15-epimer-lipoxins, but aspirin-intolerant asthmatics display a lower biosynthetic capacity than aspirin-tolerant asthmatics for these potentially protective lipid mediators. This previously unappreciated, diminished capacity for lipoxin formation by aspirin-intolerant asthmatic patients may contribute to their more severe clinical phenotype, and represents a novel paradigm for the development of chronic inflammatory disorders.

Previous preventive strategies, such as prolonged exclusive breast-feeding and delayed weaning onto solid foods, have recently been called into question. The present review considers possible risk factors and theories for the development of FA. An alternative hypothesis is proposed, suggesting that early cutaneous exposure to food protein through a disrupted skin barrier leads to allergic sensitization and that early oral exposure to food allergen induces tolerance. Novel interventional strategies to prevent the development of FA are also discussed. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2012;129:1187-97.)

Sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) has been approved, notably in the European Union, as an effective alternative to subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinitis patients. Compared with SCIT, SLIT has a better safety profile. This is possibly because oral antigen-presenting cells (mostly Langerhans and myeloid dendritic cells) exhibit a tolerogenic phenotype, despite constant exposure to danger signals from food and microbes. This reduces the induction of pro-inflammatory immune responses leading to systemic allergic reactions. Oral tissues contain relatively few mast cells and eosinophils (mostly located in submucosal areas) and, in comparison with subcutaneous tissue, are less likely to give rise to anaphylactic reactions. SLIT-associated immune responses include the induction of circulating, allergen-specific Th1 and regulatory CD4+ T cells, leading to clinical tolerance. Although 4075% of patients receiving SLIT experience mild, transient local reactions in the oral mucosa, these primary reactions rarely necessitate dose reduction or treatment interruption. We discuss 11 published case reports of anaphylaxis (all nonfatal) diagnosed according to the World Allergy Organization criteria and relate this figure to the approximately 1 billion SLIT doses administered worldwide since 2000. Anaphylaxis risk factors associated with SCIT and/or SLIT should be characterized further.	[Calderon, M.

One of the several causes of the rise in morbidity associated with allergic respiratory diseases is the increased presence of outdoor air pollutants resulting from more intense energy consumption and exhaust emissions from cars and other vehicles. Urban air pollution is now a serious public health hazard. Laboratory studies confirm epidemiologic evidence that air pollution adversely affects lung function in asthmatics. Damage to airway mucous membranes and impaired mucociliary clearance caused by air pollution may facilitate access of inhaled allergens to the cells of the immune system, thus promoting sensitization of the airway. Consequently, a more severe immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated response to aeroallergens and airway inflammation could account for increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases in polluted urban areas. The most abundant components of urban air pollution in urban areas with high levels of vehicle traffic are airborne particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. In addition, the earth's temperature is increasing, mainly as a result of anthropogenic factors (eg, fossil fuel combustion and greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply, transport, industry, and agriculture), and climate change alters the concentration and distribution of air pollutants and interferes with the seasonal presence of allergenic pollens in the atmosphere by prolonging these periods.

We assessed the potential impact of hot weather on hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in New York City. We also explored whether the weather-disease relationship varies with socio-demographic variables. Method: We investigated effects of temperature and humidity on health by linking the daily cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalization counts with meteorologic conditions during summer, 1991-2004. We used daily mean temperature, mean apparent temperature, and 3-day moving average of apparent temperature as the exposure indicators. Threshold effects for health risks of meteorologic conditions were assessed by log-linear threshold models, after controlling for ozone, day of week, holidays, and long-term trend. Stratified analyses were used to evaluate temperature-demographic interactions. Results: For all 3 exposure indicators, each degree C above the threshold of the temperature-health effect curve (29 degrees C-36 degrees C) was associated with a 2.7%-3.1% increase in same-day hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, and an increase of 1.4%-3.6% in lagged hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diseases. These increases for respiratory admissions were greater for Hispanic persons (6.1%/degrees C) and the elderly (4.7%/degrees C). At high temperatures, admission rates increased for chronic airway obstruction, asthma, ischemic heart disease, and cardiac dysrhythmias, but decreased for hypertension and heart failure. Conclusions: Extreme high temperature appears to increase hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disorders in New York City. Elderly and Hispanic residents may be particularly vulnerable to the temperature effects on respiratory illnesses.

There is an increasing prevalence of reduced responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy in severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The molecular mechanism of this remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that histone deacetylase activity, which is critical to glucocorticoid function, is altered by oxidant stress and may be involved in the development of glucocorticoid insensitivity. Objectives: To determine the role of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) in the development of cigarette smoke-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity. Methods: Wild-type, PI3K gamma knock-out and PI3K delta kinase dead knock-in transgenic mice were used in a model of cigarette smoke-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity. Peripheral lung tissue was obtained from six healthy nonsmokers, nine smokers with normal lung function, and eight patients with COPD. Measurements and Main Results: In vitro oxidative stress activates PI3K and induced a relative glucocorticoid resistance, which is restored by PI3K inhibition. In vivo, cigarette smoke exposure in mice increased tyrosine nitration of histone deacetylase 2 in the lung, correlating with reduced histone deacetylase 2 activity and reduced glucocorticoid function. Histone deacetylase 2 activity and the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids were restored in PI3K delta kinase dead knock-in but not PI3K gamma knock-out smoke-exposed mice compared with wild type mice, correlating with reduced histone deacetylase 2 tyrosine nitration. Glucocorticoid receptor expression was significantly reduced in smoke-exposed mice, in smokers with normal lung function, and in patients with COPD. Conclusions: These data show that therapeutic inhibition of PI3K delta may restore glucocorticoid function in oxidative stress-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity.

The undeveloped lung is more vulnerable to assault and less able to fully repair itself when injury disrupts morphogenesis. Children spend more time outside, where concentrations of combustion-generated air pollution are generally higher. Children have higher baseline ventilation rates and are more physically active than adults, thus exposing their lungs to more air pollution. Nasal breathing in adults reduces some pollution concentrations, but children are more typically mouth-breathers - suggesting that the composition of the exposure mixture at the alveolar level may be different. Finally, higher ventilation rates and mouth-breathing may pull air pollutants deeper into children's lungs, thereby making clearance slower and more difficult. Children also have immature immune systems, which plays a significant role in asthma. The observed consequences of early life exposure to adverse levels of air pollutants include diminished lung function and increased susceptibility to acute respiratory illness and asthma. Exposure to diesel exhaust, in particular, is an area of concern for multiple endpoints, and deserves further research.

Objective: We measured the association between microbial exposure assessed at 3 months and the development of atopic sensitization and doctor-diagnosed (DD) asthma and wheeze in the first 4 years in a birth cohort study of children with atopic mothers. Methods: Endotoxin, fungal (1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucans, extracellular polysaccharides from the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus (EPS-Pen/Asp), and dust on living room floors were measured at 3 months of age. Serum IgE levels against common allergens were determined at 1 and 4 years, and questionnaire information about respiratory morbidity was collected yearly. Results: Microbial levels in mattresses were low and not associated with serum IgE levels, DD asthma, and wheeze. Floor levels of biocontaminants and dust, on the other hand, were inversely associated with DD asthma, being most pronounced for endotoxin (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.210.77) and EPS-Pen/Asp (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-0.99). Mutual adjustment for other exposures did not significantly after the results for endotoxin and only moderately affected the results for EPS-Pen/Asp. Persistent wheeze was also consistently less common in the high-exposure group, being significant only for EPS-PenlAsp (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.96). Transient wheeze and wheeze in the past 12 months were also reduced, but effects were smaller and not significant. Relationships with serum-specific IgE levels, which could only be assessed in 41% at age 4 years, were less pronounced and statistically significant only for EPS-Pen/Asp. Conclusions: Early exposure to common microbial contaminants, including fungal agents, might protect against asthma.

TRPV1 is activated by noxious temperature, low extracellular pH and diverse lipid derivatives, and is uniquely sensitive to vanilloid molecules, including capsaicin. TRPV1 expression and sensitivity is highly regulated by diverse G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors. Other exogenous or endogenous chemical agents, including reactive oxygen species, ethanol and hydrogen sulphide sensitize/activate TRPV1. In the airways, TRPV1 agonists; cause cough, bronchoconstriction, microvascular leakage, hyperreactivity and hypersecretion. Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more sensitive to the tussive effect of TRPV1 agonists and TRPV1 activation may contribute to respiratory symptoms caused by acidic media present in the airways during asthma exacerbation, gastroesophageal reflux induced asthma or in other conditions. TRPV1 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of these diseases. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wheezing in infants living near truck and bus traffic	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						diesel; traffic; truck; bus; wheezing; geographic information system; infants	DIESEL EXHAUST PARTICLES; CHRONIC RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; AIR-POLLUTION; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; PARTICULATE MATTER; CYTOKINE PRODUCTION; VEHICLE EMISSIONS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; FINE PARTICLES; URBAN AIR	Background: Previous studies of air pollution have not examined the association between exposure to varying types, distance, and amounts of traffic and wheezing in very young infants. Objective: We sought to determine the relationship between types of traffic, traffic volume, and distance and wheezing among infants less than 1 year of age. Methods: A geographic information system and a classification scheme were developed to categorize infants enrolled in the study as living near moving truck and bus traffic (highway > 50 miles per hour, > 1000 trucks daily, < 400 m), stop-and-go truck and bus traffic (< 50 miles per hour, < 100 m), or unexposed and not residing near either. Symptom data were based on health questionnaires administered to parents when the infants were 6 months of age and monthly health diaries. Results: Infants living very near (< 100 m) stop-and-go bus and truck traffic had a significantly increased prevalence of wheezing (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.15-5.42) when compared with unexposed infants. The prevalence of wheezing among nonwhite infants was at least twice that of white infants, regardless of exposure. Infants living less than 400 m from a high volume of moving traffic, however, did not have an increased prevalence of wheezing. Conclusion: These results suggest that the distance from and type of traffic exposures are more significant risk factors than traffic volume for wheezing in early infancy.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (NOD1) is a cytosolic receptor sensing a muropeptide found mostly in gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycans. NOD1 is located on chromosome 7p14-p15, a region that has been linked with atopy. Recently, polymorphisms of the closely related NOD2 have been associated with atopy-related traits. Objectives: Within a large population-based cohort of German adults (n = 1417), a case-control population for atopic eczema (n = 454), and a large cohort of parent-offspring trios for atopic eczema (189 trios), we evaluated 11 NOD1 polymorphisms for associations with atopic phenotypes. Methods: Subjects were phenotyped by standardized questionnaires and interviews, skin examination, and serum IgE measurements. Genotyping was performed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Results: Analyses revealed significant association of one NOD1 haplotype with atopic eczema in the population-based cohort (P = .004) and the case-control population (P = .003). Another NOD1 haplotype was associated with decreased total IgE (P = .008). In addition, significant associations with total serum IgE levels were observed for polymorphisms rs2907748 (P = .006), rs2907749 (P = .012), and rs2075822 (P = .018). These polymorphisms were significantly associated with atopic eczema and asthma in the family-based association analyses (P = .001-043). Seven polymorphisms showed significant transmission distortion for total IgE levels (P values < .0001-.029). Conclusion: These data indicate that genetic variants within NOD1 are important determinants of atopy susceptibility.

Within the context of a birth cohort study, we investigated the association between preschool lung function and phenotypes of wheeze. From parentally reported history of wheeze (interviewer-administered questionnaire, age 3 and 5 years), children were classified as never wheezers, transient early wheezers, late-onset wheezers, or persistent wheezers. Lung function (specific airway resistance [sRaw]; kPa/second) was assessed at age 3 (n = 463) and 5 years (n = 690). Persistent wheezers had markedly poorer lung function compared with other groups. In children who had wheezed by age 3, the risk of persistent wheeze increased with increased sRaw (odds ratio [OR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-22.0; p = 0.02). In a multivariate model, increasing sRaw (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.2-25.9; p = 0.03) and the child's sensitization (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.8; p = 0.008) were significant independent predictors of persistent wheezing. We found no association between lung function at age 3 and late-onset wheeze in children who had not wheezed previously (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.07-5.3; p = 0.64). In conclusion, poor lung function at age 3 predicted the subsequent persistence of symptoms in children who had wheezed within the first 3 years, but was not associated with the onset of wheeze after age 3 in children who had not wheezed previously.

Therefore highly trained athletes are repeatedly and strongly exposed to cold air during winter training and to many pollen allergens in spring and summer. Competitive swimmers inhale and microaspirate large amounts of air that floats above the water surface, which means exposure to chlorine derivatives from swimming pool disinfectants. In the summer Olympic Games, 4% to 15% of the athletes showed evidence of asthma or used anti-asthmatic medication. Asthma is most commonly found in endurance events, such as cycling, swimming, or long-distance running. The risk of asthma is especially increased among competitive swimmers, of which 36% to 79% show bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or histamine. The risk of asthma is closely associated with atopy and its severity among athletes. A few studies have investigated occurrence of exercise-induced bronchospasm among highly trained athletes, The occurrences of exercise-induced bronchospasm vary from 3% to 35% and depend on testing environment, type of exercise used, and athlete population tested. Mild eosinophilic airway inflammation has been shown to affect elite swimmers and cross-country skiers. This eosinophilic inflammation correlates with clinical parameters (ie, exercise-induced bronchial symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness). Athletes commonly use antiasthmatic medication to treat their exercise-induced bronchial symptoms. However, controlled studies on their long-term effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in the athletes are lacking. Follow-up studies on asthma in athletes are also lacking. What will happen to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation after discontinuation of competitional career is unclear. In the future, follow-up studies on bronchial responsiveness and airway inflammation, as well as controlled studies on both short- and long-term effects of antiasthmatic drugs in the athletes are needed.

Recent evidence in mice has identified a "critical window" early in life where gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in experimental asthma. However, current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or are involved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, and show that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterial taxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal acetate and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these four bacterial taxa ameliorated airway inflammation in their adult progeny, demonstrating a causal role of these bacterial taxa in averting asthma development. These results enhance the potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of probiotics, to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in children.

MHCII-Mediated Dialog between Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells and CD4(+) T Cells Potentiates Type 2 Immunity and Promotes Parasitic Helminth Expulsion	IMMUNITY			English	Article							ALLERGIC LUNG INFLAMMATION; DUST-MITE ALLERGEN; DENDRITIC CELLS; IN-VIVO; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; CYSTEINE PROTEASE; ANTIBODY-RESPONSE; TH2 RESPONSES; IL-4; EXPRESSION	Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) release interleukin-13 (IL-13) during protective immunity to helminth infection and detrimentally during allergy and asthma. Using two mouse models to deplete ILC2s in vivo, we demonstrate that T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses are impaired in the absence of ILC2s. We show that MHCII-expressing ILC2s interact with antigen-specific T cells to instigate a dialog in which IL-2 production from T cells promotes ILC2 proliferation and IL-13 production. Deletion of MHCII renders IL-13-expressing ILC2s incapable of efficiently inducing Nippostrongylus brasiliensis expulsion. Thus, during transition to adaptive T cell-mediated immunity, the ILC2 and T cell crosstalk contributes to their mutual maintenance, expansion and cytokine production. This interaction appears to augment dendritic-cell-induced T cell activation and identifies a previously unappreciated pathway in the regulation of type-2 immunity.

Chronic rhinosinusitis: Epidemiology and medical management	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						Rhinosinusitis; sinusitis; nasal polyposis; epidemiology; medical management; treatment	ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; ALLERGIC FUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; CHRONIC HYPERPLASTIC SINUSITIS; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; AQUEOUS NASAL SPRAY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DOUBLE-BLIND; ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION; MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE	Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 12.5% of the US population. On epidemiologic grounds, some association has been found between CRS prevalence and air pollution, active cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, perennial allergic rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux. The majority of pediatric and adult patients with CRS are immune competent. Data on genetic associations with CRS are still sparse. Current consensus definitions subclassify CRS into CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP), CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). Evaluation and medical management of CRS has been the subject of several recent consensus reports. The highest level of evidence for treatment for CRSsNP exists for saline lavage, intranasal steroids, and long-term macrolide antibiotics. The highest level of evidence for treatment of CRSwNP exists for intranasal steroids, systemic glucocorticoids, and topical steroid irrigations. Aspirin desensitization is beneficial for patients with aspirin-intolerant CRSwNP. Sinus surgery followed by use of systemic steroids is recommended for AFRS. Other modalities of treatment, such as antibiotics for patients with purulent infection and antifungal drugs for patients with AFRS, are potentially useful despite a lack of evidence from controlled treatment trials. The various modalities of medical treatment are reviewed in the context of recent consensus documents and the author's personal experience. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011; 128:693-707.)

Orchestrating house dust mite-associated allergy in the lung	TRENDS IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							PROTEASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-2; THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; ADAPTIVE IMMUNE-RESPONSES; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; DENDRITIC CELLS; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; DERMATOPHAGOIDES-PTERONYSSINUS; T-CELL; STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY; NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME	House dust mites (HDM; Dermatophagoides sp.) are one of the commonest aeroallergens worldwide and up to 85% of asthmatics are typically HDM allergic. Allergenicity is associated both with the mites themselves and with ligands derived from mite-associated bacterial and fungal products. Murine models of allergic airways disease for asthma research have recently switched from the use of surrogate allergen ovalbumin together with adjuvant to use of the HDM extract. This has accelerated understanding of how adaptive and innate immunity generate downstream pathology. We review the myriad ways in which HDM allergic responses are orchestrated. Understanding the molecular pathways that elicit HDM-associated pathology is likely to reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

Interactions between Innate Antiviral and Atopic Immunoinflammatory Pathways Precipitate and Sustain Asthma Exacerbations in Children	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							FC-EPSILON-RI; ALLERGIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; KILLER T-CELLS; DENDRITIC CELLS; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; VIRAL-INFECTION; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; VIRUS-INFECTION; EXPRESSION	Severe asthma exacerbations in children requiring hospitalization are typically associated with viral infection and occur almost exclusively among atopics, but the significance of these comorbidities is unknown. We hypothesized that underlying interactions between immunoinflammatory pathways related to responses to aeroallergen and virus are involved, and that evidence of these interactions is detectable in circulating cells during exacerbations. To address this hypothesis we used a genomics-based approach involving profiling of PBMC subpopulations collected during exacerbation vs convalescence by microarray and flow cytometry. We demonstrate that circulating T cells manifest the postactivated "exhausted" phenotype during exacerbations, whereas monocyte/dendritic cell populations display up-regulated CCR2 expression accompanied by phenotypic changes that have strong potential for enhancing local inflammation after their recruitment to the atopic lung. Notably, up-regulation of Fc epsilon R1, which is known to markedly amplify capacity for allergen uptake/presentation to Th2 effector cells via IgE-mediated allergen capture, and secondarily programming of IL-4/IL-13-dependent IL-13R(+) alternatively activated macrophages that have been demonstrated in experimental settings to be a potent source of autocrine IL-13 production. We additionally show that this disease-associated activation profile can be reproduced in vitro by cytokine exposure of atopic monocytes, and furthermore that IFN-alpha can exert both positive and negative roles in the process. Our findings suggest that respiratory viral infection in atopic children may initiate an atopy-dependent cascade that amplifies and sustains airway inflammation initiated by innate antiviral immunity via harnessing underlying atopy-associated mechanisms. These interactions may account for the unique susceptibility of atopics to severe viral-induced asthma exacerbations. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 183: 2793-2800.

The prevalence of allergies is steadily increasing and seems to be associated with modern lifestyle. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high living standards and hygienic conditions are correlated with an increased risk for the development of an allergic disease. This so-called "hygiene hypothesis" states that due to reduced exposure to microbial components, the proposed allergy-preventing potential of these factors is no more present in sufficient qualities and/or quantities, which leads to an imbalance of the immune system with a predisposition to the development of allergic disorders. Meanwhile, several epidemiological studies were conducted supporting this concept and generating novel ideas for the underlying mechanisms that were then followed up by use of well-defined animal models and human studies. The current view of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these phenomena includes changes in the fine balancing of T helper cell 1 (Th1), Th2 and regulatory T cell (Treg) responses which are triggered by altered or missing innate immune cell activation. In fact, proper activation of cells of the innate immune system via their so-called pattern recognition receptors has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in early shaping of the immune system and suppression of the development of Th2-driven allergic immune responses. These processes start already in utero and prenatal as well as early postnatal developmental stages seem to represent a certain "window of opportunity" for allergy-preventing environmental influences.

Scabies: a ubiquitous neglected skin disease	LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Review							CRUSTED NORWEGIAN SCABIES; HOUSE-DUST MITE; TEA TREE OIL; SARCOPTES-SCABIEI; DERMATOPHAGOIDES-PTERONYSSINUS; ORAL IVERMECTIN; IN-VITRO; NOSOCOMIAL OUTBREAK; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; EPIDEMIC SCABIES	Scabies has been a scourge among human beings for thousands of years. Its worldwide occurrence with epidemics during war, famine, and overcrowding is responsible for an estimated 300 million people currently infested. Scabies refers to the various skin lesions produced by female mites, and their eggs and scybala that are deposited in the epidermis, leading to delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Recent immunological findings such as cross-reactivity with house dust mite allergens and an altered T-helper-1/T-helper-2 pattern contribute to a better understanding of the pathomechanism. Furthermore, progress in molecular biology and cloning of relevant antigens could enable the development of a diagnostic ELISA system and candidate vaccines in the near future. Typical and atypical clinical presentations with pruritus as a hallmark of scabies occur in young, pregnant, immunocompromised, and elderly patients and include bullous and crusted (Norwegian) manifestations as well as those masked by steroid use (scabies incognito). This article reviews scabies management strategies in developed countries and resource-poor communities as well as typical complications, including the emergence of resistance and drug-related adverse events. Other problems such as post-scabies eczema and reinfestation, and newer treatments such as ivermectin are also discussed.

ALLERGY			English	Article						children; food allergy; specific oral tolerance induction		Background: The standard treatment of food allergy is elimination of the incriminated food from the diet. Specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) seems to be a promising approach for a causal treatment; however, it is unclear whether the tolerance achieved is transient or persistent. We report on a subset of three patients of a larger ongoing study who were treated successfully with SOTI treatment, but experienced a secondary loss of tolerance after a period of allergen avoidance. Methods: The patients suffered from IgE-mediated allergy either to cow's milk (CM) (patient A) or hen's egg (HE) (patients B and C), confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). SOTI treatment was performed at home on a daily basis until tolerance to a maximum of 250 ml CM or 4.5 g lyophilized HE protein was achieved. The daily maintenance dose was 100 ml CM or 2.5 g HE protein. Results: Patients A, B and C reached tolerance to the maximum dose after 37, 41 and 52 weeks, respectively. According to the protocol, patients A and B performed a strict secondary elimination diet for 2 months prior to a follow-up DBPCFC after a maintenance phase of 27 and 39 weeks, respectively. Patient C discontinued treatment for 2 days after 4 weeks on the maintenance dose. Despite previous tolerance, on re-exposure to the allergen all patients experienced moderate systemic allergic reactions. Conclusions: We conclude that SOTI can induce transient tolerance in food allergy, but does not necessarily lead to its permanent abrogation. Regular allergen intake seems necessary to maintain the established tolerance.

Objective: In this study, it was investigated whether the stress-inducible enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) of human and fungal origin might act as an autoallergen in atopic dermatitis. Methods: Patients with AD (n = 69; mean SCORAD [SCORing Atopic Dermatitis], 27) and other inflammatory skin diseases as well as with inhalant allergies were investigated. The presence of specific IgE against recombinant MnSOD of fungal and human origin and the fungal extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus and Malassezia sympodialis was measured by CAP, ELISA, skin prick test, and in subset of patients also by atopy patch tests (APTs) and PBMC proliferation assays. Cross-reactivity between allergens was determined by CAP inhibition. The presence of MnSOD in human skin in various inflammatory skin conditions was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Specific IgE antibodies against human MnSOD correlating with the disease activity were found in 29 out of 67 patients with AD. The human protein was able to induce in vitro T-cell reactivity and eczematous reactions in APT in MnSOD-sensitized patients with AD. MnSOD was upregulated in various inflammatory skin reactions and APT skin specimens. Cosensitization to structurally related and cross-reacting fungal MnSOD and the skin-colonizing yeast M sympodialis was observed in all patients sensitized against human MnSOD. Conclusion: Human MnSOD may play a role as an autoallergen in a subset of patients with AD, including nonatopic eczema. By molecular mimicry leading to cross-reactivity such sensitization might be induced primarily by exposure to environmental fungal MnSOD of M sympodialis.

We hypothesized that prenatal exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), important components of diesel exhaust and other combustion sources, may be associated with respiratory symptoms in young children. We also hypothesized that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may worsen symptoms beyond that observed to be associated with PAH alone. Design/participants: To test our hypotheses, we recruited 303 pregnant women from northern Manhattan believed to be at high risk for exposure to both PAH and ETS, collected 48-h personal PAH exposure measurements, and monitored their children prospectively. Results: By 12 months of age, more cough and wheeze were reported in children exposed to prenatal PAH in concert with ETS postnatally (PAH X ETS interaction odds ratios [ORs], 1.41 [p < 0.01] and 1.29 [p < 0.05], respectively). By 24 months, difficulty breathing and probable asthma were reported more frequently among children exposed to prenatal PAH and ETS postnatally (PAR X ETS ORs, 1.54 and 1.64, respectively [p < 0.05]). Conclusions: Our results suggest that early exposure to airborne PAH and ETS can lead to increased respiratory symptoms and probable asthma by age 12 to 24 months. Interventions to lower the risk of respiratory disease in young children living in the inner city may need to address the importance of multiple environmental exposures.

Increasing evidence points toward a role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We wanted to determine the relation of COPD and asthma with the development of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The Nurses' Health Study is a prospective cohort study. From 1988-1996, 103,614 female nurses were asked biennially about a physician diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and diabetes. RESULTS - During 8 years of follow-up, we documented a total of 2,959 new cases of type 2 diabetes. The risk of type 2 diabetes was significantly higher for patients with COPD than those without (multivariate relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8). By contrast, the risk of type 2 diabetes among asthmatic patients was not increased (1.0, 0.8-1.2). The asthma results remained non-significant even when we evaluated diabetes risk by duration of asthma exposure. CONCLUSIONS - Our findings suggest that COPD may be a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Differences in the inflammation and cytokine profile between COPD and asthma might explain why COPD, but not asthma, is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

Exposures to particles, including allergens, may cause or exacerbate asthma symptoms. As part of an epidemiologic study of inner-city children with asthma, continuous (10-min average) measurements of particle concentrations were made for 2-week periods in 294 homes drawn from seven cities. Measurements were made using an optical scattering device that is most sensitive to fine particles. The concentrations recorded by these devices were corrected to agree with colocated outdoor gravimetric PM2.5 monitors. Indoor concentrations in the homes averaged 27.7 (standard deviation = 35.9) mug/m(3), compared with concurrent outdoor concentrations of 13.6 (7.5) mug/m(3). A multivariate model indicated that outdoor particles penetrated indoors with an efficiency of 0.48 and were therefore responsible for only 25% of the mean indoor concentration. The major indoor source was smoking, which elevated indoor concentrations by 37 mug/m(3) in the 10 1 homes with smokers. Other significant sources included frying, smoky cooking events, use of incense, and apartment housing, although the increases due to these events ranged only from 3 to 6 mug/m(3). The 10-min averaging time allowed calculation of an average diurnal variation, showing large increases in the evening due to smoking and smaller increases at meal times due to cooking. Most of the observed variance in indoor concentrations was day to day, with roughly similar contributions to the variance from visit to visit and home to home within a city and only a small contribution made by variance among cities. The small variation among cities and the similarity across cities of the observed indoor air particle distributions suggest that sources of indoor concentrations do not vary considerably from one city to the next, and thus that simple models can predict indoor air concentrations in cities having only outdoor measurements.

Objective measurements are now required by some sporting bodies to support a diagnosis of asthma or EIB to justify use of beta-agonists. Such measurements could include bronchial provocation with methacholine, with eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) of dry air (a surrogate for exercise), or both. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between asthma symptoms and responses to methacholine and the EVH challenge in a group of unselected elite summer-sport athletes. The outcome would be to inform practitioners of a suitable objective approach to identifying those with asthma and EIB. Methods: Fifty elite summer-sport athletes with or without asthma were recruited from sporting teams and sports medicine centers throughout Melbourne, Australia. All subjects completed a respiratory questionnaire and, on separate days, underwent a bronchoprovocation challenge test with methacholine and EVH. Results: Forty-two subjects reported one or more respiratory symptoms in the past year, 9 had positive methacholine challenge results (mean PD20 of 1.69 +/- 2.05 mumol), and 25 had posit e EVH challenge results (mean fall in FEV1 of 25.4% +/- 15%). Although all subjects with positive methacholine challenge results had positive EVH challenge results, methacholine had a negative predictive value of only 61% and a sensitivity of 36% for identifying those responsive to EVH. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of EIB in elite athletes might be different from that of asthma, and as such, neither symptoms nor the methacholine challenge test should be used exclusively for identifying EIB.

Health problems of swimmers in indoor pools have traditionally been attributed to the chlorine in the water. Chlorine reacts with bodily proteins to form chloramines; the most volatile and prevalent in the air above swimming pools is nitrogen trichloride. Two lifeguards and one swimming teacher with symptoms suggestive of occupational asthma kept 2-hourly measurements of peak expiratory flow at home and at work, analysed using the occupational asthma system (OASYS) plotter, and/or had specific bronchial challenge testing to nitrogen trichloride, or a workplace challenge. Air measurement in one of the pools showed the nitrogen trichloride levels to be 0.1-0.57 mg.m(-3), which was similar to other studies. Two workers had peak expiratory flow measurements showing occupational asthma (OASYS-2 scores 2.88 and 3.8), both had a positive specific challenge to nitrogen trichloride at 0.5 mg.m(-3) with negative challenges to chlorine released from sodium hypochlorite. The third worker had a positive workplace challenge. Swimming-pool asthma due to airborne nitrogen trichloride can occur in workers who do not enter the water because of this chloramine. The air above indoor swimming pools therefore needs to be assessed and managed as carefully as the water.

This review focuses on occupational allergy in the fishing and seafood processing industry. Review-Workers involved in either manual or automated processing of crabs' prawns, mussels, fish, and fishmeal production are commonly exposed to various constituents of seafood. Aerosolisation of seafood and cooking fluid during processing are potential occupational situations that could result in sensitisation through inhalation. There is great variability of aerosol exposure within and among various jobs with reported allergen concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 5.061(mug/m(3)). Occupational dermal exposure occurs as a result of unprotected handling of seafood and its byproducts. Occupational allergies have been reported in workers exposed to arthropods (crustaceans), molluscs, pisces (bony fish) and other agents derived from seafood. The prevalence of occupational asthma ranges from 7% to 36%, and for occupational protein contact dermatitis, from 3% to 11%. These health outcomes are mainly due to high molecular weight proteins in seafood causing an IgE mediated response. Cross reactivity between various species within a major seafood grouping also occurs. Limited evidence from dose-response relations indicate that development of symptoms is related to duration or intensity of exposure. The evidence for atopy as a risk factor for occupational sensitisation and asthma is supportive, whereas evidence for cigarette smoking is limited. Disruption of the intact skin barrier seems to be an important added risk factor for occupational protein contact dermatitis. Conclusion-The range of allergic disease associated with occupational exposure to crab is well characterised, whereas for other seafood agents the evidence is somewhat limited. There is a need for further epidemiological studies to better characterise this risk. More detailed characterisation of specific protein antigens in aerosols and associated establishment of dose-response relations for acute and chronic exposure to seafood; the respective roles of skin contact and inhalational exposure in allergic sensitisation and cross reactivity; and the contribution of host associated factors in the development of occupational seafood allergies are important areas for future research.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of short-term exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) in asthmatics, by specifically addressing the effects on airway hyperresponsiveness, lung function and airway inflammation. Fourteen nonsmoking, atopic asthmatics with stable disease, on continuous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, were included. All were hyperresponsive to methacholine. Each subject was exposed to DE (particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum (PM10) 300 mug(.)m(-3)) and air during Ih on two separate occasions. Lung function was measured before and immediately after the exposures. Sputum induction was performed 6 h, and methacholine inhalation test 24 h, after each exposure. Exposure to DE was associated with a significant increase in the degree of hyperresponsiveness, as compared to after air, of 0.97 doubling concentrations at 24 h after exposure (p < 0.001). DE also induced a significant increase in airway resistance (p = 0.004) and in sputum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (p = 0.048). No changes were detected in sputum levels of methyl-histamine, eosinophil cationic protein, myeloperoxidase and IL-8. This study indicated that short-term exposure to diesel exhaust, equal to high ambient levels of particulate matter, is associated with adverse effects in asthmatic airways, even in the presence of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The increase in airway responsiveness may provide an important link to epidemiological findings exacerbations of asthma following exposure to particulate matter.

Lung mRNA levels of lymphotoxin-beta and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were unchanged. In murine C10 alveolar cells and an NF-kappa B-luciferase reporter cell line, exposure to PM2.5 at noncytotoxic concentrations resulted in increases in transcriptional activation of NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression which were inhibited in the presence of catalase. Early and persistent increases in intracellular oxidants, as measured by flow cytometry and cell imaging using the oxidant probe 2'-7'-dichlorofluoroscin diacetate, were observed in epithelial cells exposed to PM2.5, and ultrafine carbon black particles.

The effectiveness of intervention measures on the primary prevention of asthma has not been well studied. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention program in the primary prevention of asthma in high-risk infants (in this study, infants are defined as persons from birth to the age of 1 year). Design: Prospective, prenatally randomized, controlled study with follow-up through the age of 1 year. Setting: University hospital-based settings at 2 Canadian centers: Vancouver, British Columbia, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: A total of 545 high-risk infants (at least 1 first-degree relative with asthma or 2 first-degree relatives with other IgE-mediated allergic diseases) identified before birth. Interventions: Avoidance of house dust mite and pet allergens and environmental tobacco smoke, encouragement of breastfeeding, and supplementation with a partially hydrolyzed formula. Main Outcome Measures: Probable or possible asthma, rhinitis without apparent colds, and a prick skin test result positive for common inhalant allergens. Results: Thirty-eight (15.1%) of the 251 infants available for assessment in the intervention group and 49 (20.2%) of the 242 infants available for assessment in the control group fulfilled the criteria for possible or probable asthma (adjusted relative risk, 0.66; 90% confidence interval, 0.44-0.98). Also, 16.7% of the infants in the intervention group and 27.3% of the infants in the control group developed rhinitis without colds (adjusted relative risk, 0.51; 90% confidence interval, 0.35-0.74). The incidence of positive skin test results to 1 or more inhalant allergens was similar in both groups (4.4% in the intervention group and 4.6% in the control group). Conclusions: Our multifaceted intervention program resulted in a modest but significant (P = .04) reduction in the risk of possible or probable asthma and rhinitis without apparent colds at the age of 12 months in high-risk infants. In the absence of a validated definition of asthma at the age of 12 months, follow-up studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention program in the primary prevention of asthma in high-risk infants.

Mechanisms of chemical-induced innate immunity in allergic contact dermatitis	ALLERGY			English	Review						contact dermatitis; inflammation; innate immunity; NOD-like receptor; Toll-like receptor	NF-KAPPA-B; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; CELL-LINE THP-1; LYMPH-NODE ASSAY; CD8 T-CELLS; IN-VITRO; REACTIVE OXYGEN; DENDRITIC CELLS; SKIN SENSITIZERS; GENE-EXPRESSION	Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is one of the most prevalent occupational skin diseases and causes severe and long-lasting health problems in the case of chronification. It is initiated by an innate inflammatory immune response to skin contact with low molecular weight chemicals that results in the priming of chemical-specific, skin-homing CD8(+) Tc1/Tc17 and CD4(+) Th1/Th17 cells. Following this sensitization step, T lymphocytes infiltrate the inflamed skin upon challenge with the same chemical. The T cells then exert cytotoxic function and secrete inflammatory mediators to produce an eczematous skin reaction. The recent characterization of the mechanisms underlying the innate inflammatory response has revealed that contact allergens activate innate effector mechanisms and signalling pathways that are also involved in anti-infectious immunity. This emerging analogy implies infection as a potential trigger or amplifier of the sensitization to contact allergens. Moreover, new mechanistic insights into the induction of ACD identify potential targets for preventive and therapeutic intervention. We summarize here the latest findings in this area of research.

Objective To present the current data systematically associating use of biomass fuels with respiratory outcomes in rural women and children. Methods Systematic searches were conducted in 13 electronic databases. Data were abstracted from original articles that satisfied selection criteria for meta-analyses. Publication bias and heterogeneity of samples were tested. Studies with common diagnoses were analysed using random-effect models. Results A total of 2717 studies were identified. Fifty-one studies were selected for data extraction and 25 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. The overall pooled ORs indicate significant associations with acute respiratory infection in children (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.94 to 6.43), chronic bronchitis in women (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.38) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in women (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.93). In contrast, no significant association with asthma in children or women was noted. Conclusion Biomass fuel exposure is associated with diverse respiratory diseases in rural populations. Concerted efforts in improving stove design and lowering exposure to smoke emission may reduce respiratory disease associated with biomass fuel exposure.	[Po, June Y. T.; FitzGerald, J.

These studies are of high value as they tend to be less biased than studies using clinical populations and as they are important for healthcare decision makers when they allocate resources. This study aimed to review the epidemiology of hand eczema in the general population. Literature was examined using Pubmed-Medline, Biosis, Science Citation Index, and dermatology text books. On the basis of studies performed between 1964 and 2007, the point prevalence of hand eczema was around 4%, the 1-year prevalence nearly 10%, whereas the lifetime prevalence reached 15%. Based on seven studies, the median incidence rate of hand eczema was 5.5 cases/1000 person-years (women = 9.6 and men = 4.0). A high incidence rate was associated with female sex, contact allergy, atopic dermatitis, and wet work. Atopic dermatitis was the single most important risk factor for hand eczema. Hand eczema resulted in medical consultations in 70%, sick leave (> 7 days) in about 20%, and job change in about 10%. Mean sick time was longer among those with allergic hand eczema than those with atopic and irritant hand eczema. Moderate to severe extension of hand eczema was the strongest risk factor for persistence of hand eczema. Other risk factors included early onset of hand eczema and childhood eczema. The aetiology of hand eczema is multifactorial and includes environmental as well as genetic factors. Future studies should focus on unresolved areas of hand eczema, for example, genetic predisposition.

A simple technique to characterize proximal and peripheral nitric oxide exchange using constant flow exhalations and an axial diffusion model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						model; airway; alveolar	RESPIRATORY-TRACT; EXHALED AIR; BREATH-HOLD; ASTHMA; ALVEOLAR; IMPACT; DYNAMICS; HUMANS; LUNGS; NO	The most common technique employed to describe pulmonary gas exchange of nitric oxide (NO) combines multiple constant flow exhalations with a two-compartment model (2CM) that neglects 1) the trumpet shape (increasing surface area per unit volume) of the airway tree and 2) gas phase axial diffusion of NO. However, recent evidence suggests that these features of the lungs are important determinants of NO exchange. The goal of this study is to present an algorithm that characterizes NO exchange using multiple constant flow exhalations and a model that considers the trumpet shape of the airway tree and axial diffusion (model TMAD). Solution of the diffusion equation for the TMAD for exhalation flows > 100 ml/s can be reduced to the same linear relationship between the NO elimination rate and the flow; however, the interpretation of the slope and the intercept depend on the model. We tested the TMAD in healthy subjects (n = 8) using commonly used and easily performed exhalation flows (100, 150, 200, and 250 ml/s). Compared with the 2CM, estimates (mean +/- SD) from the TMAD for the maximum airway flux are statistically higher (J'aw(NO) = 770 +/- 470 compared with 440 +/- 270 pl/s), whereas estimates for the steady-state alveolar concentration are statistically lower (CA(NO) = 0.66 +/- 0.98 compared with 1.2 +/- 0.80 parts/billion). Furthermore, CANO from the TMAD is not different from zero. We conclude that proximal (airways) NO production is larger than previously predicted with the 2CM and that peripheral (respiratory bronchioles and alveoli) NO is near zero in healthy subjects.

We compare these effects based on the experience in Iranian veterans exposed to the agent during the Iran-Iraq conflict (1983-88). The first clinical manifestations of sulfur mustard poisoning occurred in the eyes with a sensation of grittiness, lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm, and corneal ulceration. Respiratory effects appeared as rhinorhea, laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, and dyspnoea. Skin lesions varied from erythema to bullous necrotization. Initial leukocytosis and lymphopenia returned to normal within four weeks in recovered patients, but marked cytopenia with bone marrow failure occurred in fatal cases. Late toxic effects of sulfur mustard were most commonly found in lungs, skin and eyes. Main respiratory complications were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, asthma, large airway narrowing, and pulmonary fibrosis. Late skin lesions were hyperpigmentation, dry skin, atrophy, and hypopigmentation. Fifteen of the severely intoxicated patients were diagnosed with delayed keratitis, having corneal vascularization, thinning, and epithelial defect. Respiratory complications exacerbated over time, while cutaneous and ocular lesions decreased or remained constant. Both the severity and frequency of bronchiectatic lesions increased during long-term follow-up. The only deteriorating cutaneous complication was dry skin. The maximum incidence of delayed kaeratitis was observed 15 to 20 years after initial exposure. Being suggested as the main cause ofassociated with malignancies and recurrent infections, natural killer cells were significantly lower 16 to 20 years after intoxication.

Our scientific understanding of the spectrum of health effects of air pollution has increased, and numerous studies are finding important health effects from air pollution at levels once considered safe. Children and infants are among the most susceptible to many of the air pollutants. In addition to associations between air pollution and respiratory symptoms, asthma exacerbations, and asthma hospitalizations, recent studies have found links between air pollution and preterm birth, infant mortality, deficits in lung growth, and possibly, development of asthma. This policy statement summarizes the recent literature linking ambient air pollution to adverse health outcomes in children and includes a perspective on the current regulatory process. The statement provides advice to pediatricians on how to integrate issues regarding air quality and health into patient education and children's environmental health advocacy and concludes with recommendations to the government on promotion of effective air-pollution policies to ensure protection of children's health.

LEPTIN RECEPTOR; FACTOR-ALPHA; ASTHMA	Epidemiological data indicate an increased incidence of asthma in overweight adults and children. Ozone (O-3) is a common trigger for asthma. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare O-3-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in lean, wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice and mice that are obese as a consequence of a genetic defect in the gene encoding the satiety hormone leptin (ob/ob mice). The ob/ob mice eat excessively and weighed more than twice as much as age- and gender-matched wild-type mice. Airway responsiveness to intravenous methacholine was measured by forced oscillation. In air-exposed controls, baseline pulmonary resistance was greater, and the dose of methacholine required to double pulmonary resistance was lower in ob/ob than wild-type mice. Exposure to O-3 (2 parts/million for 3 h) caused AHR and airway inflammation in both groups of mice, but responses to O-3 were enhanced in ob/ob compared with wild-type mice. Administration of exogenous leptin did not reverse the enhanced inflammatory response observed in ob/ob mice, but augmented airway inflammation in wild-type mice. The inhaled dose of O-3 per gram of lung tissue was greater in ob/ob than wild-type mice. Our results indicate that O-3-induced airway responses are enhanced in ob/ob mice and suggest that inhaled O-3 dose may be one factor contributing to this difference, but other aspects of the obese phenotype may also contribute. Our results also indicate that the hormone leptin, which is increased in the obese, has the capacity to increase airway inflammation.

The average personal exposures to PM with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 mum (PM2.5) were similar to the average outdoor PM2.5 concentrations but significantly higher than the average indoor concentrations. Personal PM2.5 exposures in our study groups were lower than those reported in other panel studies of susceptible populations. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5, PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameters < 10 mum), and the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 were significantly higher during the heating season. The increase in outdoor PM10 in winter was primarily due to an increase in the PM2.5 fraction. A similar seasonal variation was found for personal PM2.5. The high-risk subjects in our study engaged in an equal amount of dust-generating activities compared with the healthy elderly subjects. The children in the study experienced the highest indoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Personal PM2.5 exposures varied by study group, with elderly healthy and CHD subjects having the lowest exposures and asthmatic children having the highest exposures. Within study groups, the PM2.5 exposure varied depending on residence because of different particle infiltration efficiencies. Although we found a wide range of longitudinal correlations between central-site and personal PM2.5 measurements, the longitudinal r is closely related to the particle infiltration efficiency. PM2.5 exposures among the COPD and CHD subjects can be predicted with relatively good power with a microenvironmental model composed of three microenvironments. The prediction power is the lowest for the asthmatic children.

After a single intraperitoneal sensitization to ovalbumin, the mice were exposed daily either to ovalbumin (1%) or phosphate-buffered saline aerosols from days 14 to 21. Significantly less peribronchial mononuclear cell infiltration of the airways and less lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were detected in challenged MMP-9(-/-) as compared to WT mice. In contrast, comparable numbers of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils; were observed in both genotypes. After allergen exposure, the WT mice developed a significant airway hyperresponsiveness to carbachol whereas the MMP-9(-/-) mice failed to do so. Allergen exposure induced an increase of MMP-9-related gelatinolytic activity in WT lung extracts. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed increased mRNA levels of MMP-12, MMP-14, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator after allergen exposure in the lung extracts of WT mice but not in MMP-9-deficient mice. in contrast, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 was enhanced after allergen exposure in both groups. We conclude that MMP-9 plays a key role in the development of airway inflammation after allergenexposure.

Objectives The aim of our combined patch testing and questionnaire investigation of girls in public schools and high schools/production schools was to evaluate whether the regulation has had an impact on the prevalence of nickel sensitization. Methods To find a group of girls with cars pierced mainly after implementation of the nickel-exposure regulation in Denmark, girls were recruited from the fifth and sixth grade in 12 public schools (the public school group). After the public school level almost all girls from a public school population continue their education in high schools or other schools such as production schools or technical schools. Therefore, to find girls demographically similar to the public school girls but older, and with ears pierced before implementation of the regulation, girls from seven high schools and two production schools were recruited (the high school group). Four hundred and twenty-seven girls in the public school group (mean age 12.4 years, range 10-14) and 534 in the high school group (mean age 18.8 years, range 17-22) participated. All participants filled out a questionnaire concerning ear piercing, use of oral braces and former patch testing for nickel sensitivity. Three hundred and five girls (71.4%) in the public school group and 275 (51.5%) in the high school group were patch tested or had been tested previously and the results of these tests were included in the study. The relation between the frequency of nickel sensitization and the various factors that might influence the prevalence of nickel sensitization was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The investigation was conducted from March 1999 to March 2000. Results The study showed that both increasing age and having ears pierced before 1992 enhanced the prevalence of nickel sensitization. We found that 17.1% of the girls in the high school group demonstrated a positive patch test reaction to nickel. In contrast, the prevalence of nickel sensitization in the public school group was only 3.9%. Comparing girls with and without pierced ears, the prevalence of nickel sensitization was significantly higher in girls with ears pierced before, but not after, 1992 (odds ratio 3.34 and 1.20, respectively). Only in the high school group was there a tendency that wearing oral braces before ear piercing had a protective effect on nickel sensitization, but this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions As we found an effect of ear piercing before but not after 1992, this study strongly suggests that implementation of the nickel-exposure regulation in 1992 in Denmark has had the intended effect of protecting the female population from becoming allergic to nickel.

Daily air pollution concentrations were extracted from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System database from the Environment Protection Agency in the USA. Mixed linear models and generalized estimating equation models were used to evaluate the effects of several air pollutants (ozone, sulphur dioxide (SOD, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum (PM10) on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and symptoms in 846 children with a history of asthma (ages 4-9 yrs). None of the pollutants were associated with evening PEFR or symptom reports.

In single pollutant models, each pollutant was associated with an increased incidence of morning symptoms: (odds ratio (OR)=1.16 (95%, Cl 1.02-1.30) per IQR increase in 4-day average ozone, OR=1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.70) per IQR increase in 2-day average SO2, OR=1.48 (95% CI 1.02-2.16) per IQR increase in 6-day average NO2 and OR=1.26 (95% CI 1.0 1.59) per IQR increase in 2-day average PM10. This longitudinal analysis supports previous time-series findings that at levels below current USA air-quality standards, summer-air pollution is significantly related to symptoms and decreased pulmonary function among children with asthma.

Design: Cross-sectional study, using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. Setting: Eighty-nine mobile examination centers in the United States. Participants: Twelve thousand three hundred eighty-eight African American, Mexican American, and white (non-Latino) children and adolescents, aged 2 months through 16 years, selected from a systematic random, population-based, nationally representative sample. Main Outcome Measure: Current asthma, defined by caregivers who reported that their child currently had doctor-diagnosed asthma. Results: The overall prevalence of current asthma was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-7.8). Odds ratios for current asthma from the multiple regression analysis were 4.00 (95% CI, 2.90-5.52) for children with a parental history of asthma or hay fever, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.09-3.46) for children with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) greater than or equal to the 85th percentile, and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.20-2.26) for children of African American ethnicity. African American and Mexican American children showed a consistent prevalence of current asthma across age while white children showed an increase in prevalence with age. The 2 highest-risk subgroups identified by the signal detection analysis were composed of children with a parental history of asthma or hay fever who were 10 years or older with a body mass index greater than or equal to the 85th percentile (31.0% current asthma), and children with a parental history who were 10 years or younger and of African American ethnicity (15.6% current asthma). Conclusions: The findings from this analysis show a strong independent association between obesity and current asthma in children and adolescents, and confirm previous reports of a parental history of asthma or hay fever and African American ethnicity as additional important risk factors.

The secondary aim of the study was to compare discriminative capacity (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the reversibility test for the diagnosis of asthma) for each of the lung function tests applied in the study. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) as measured by whole-body plethysmography, respiratory resistance as measured with the interrupter technique (Rint), and respiratory resistance and reactance at 5 Hz (Rrs5, Xrs5, respectively) as measured with the impulse oscillation technique were assessed before and 20 min after inhalation of terbutaline from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler via a metal spacer by 92 children (37 healthy controls and 55 asthmatic subjects). The study of healthy children followed a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, whereas the study of asthmatic children was open. Baseline lung function was significantly decreased in asthmatic children as compared with healthy control subjects as reflected by all techniques used in the study. sRaw, Rint, and Rrs5, but not Xrs5, improved significantly with terbutaline as compared with placebo in healthy control subjects. Lung function Improved to a significantly greater extent in asthmatic children than in control subjects as reflected by all methods. sRaw provided the best discriminative power of such a bronchodilator response, with a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 81% at the cutoff level of a 25% decrease in sRaw after bronchodilator administration. In conclusion, bronchodilator response measured by sRaw allows a separation of asthmatic from healthy young children. This may help define asthma in this clinically difficult-to-manage group of young wheezy children. The sensitivity and specificity of the other methods used in the study were less than those of sRaw.

Objective: We sought to prospectively evaluate the long-term effect of SLIT given for 3, 4, or 5 years and to compare the effect of those different durations. Methods: In this prospective open controlled study we followed up patients with respiratory allergy who were monosensitized to mites for 15 years. The subjects were divided in 4 groups receiving drug therapy alone or SLIT for 3, 4, or 5 years. Clinical scores, skin sensitizations, methacholine reactivity, and nasal eosinophil counts were evaluated every year during the winter months. The clinical effect was considered to persist until clinical scores remained at less than 50% of the baseline value, and then patients underwent another course of SLIT. Results: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled, and 59 completed the study. In the 12 control subjects no relevant change in clinical scores was seen throughout the study. In the patients receiving SLIT for 3 years, the clinical benefit persisted for 7 years. In those receiving immunotherapy for 4 or 5 years, the clinical benefit persisted for 8 years. New sensitizations occurred in all the control subjects over 15 years and in less than a quarter of the patients receiving SLIT (21%, 12%, and 11%, respectively). The second course of vaccination induced a benefit more rapidly than the first course. The behavior of bronchial hyperreactivity and nasal eosinophils paralleled the clinical score. Conclusion: Under the present conditions, it can be suggested that a 4-year duration of SLIT is the optimal choice because it induces a long-lasting clinical improvement similar to that seen with a 5-year course and greater than that of a 3-year vaccination.

We found that extracts from the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and from the mold Aspergillus fumigatus stimulated a rapid and robust production of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs), proinflammatory lipid mediators, from mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Con A affinity chromatography of the Df extract revealed that the relevant ligand is a glycan(s), suggesting stimulation via a dendritic cell (DC) lectin receptor. Cys-LT production in BMDCs from wild-type mice was inhibited by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors and was abolished in BMDCs from FcR gamma(-/-) mice, implicating either Dectin-2 or DC immunoactivating receptor. Transfection of each receptor in bone marrow-derived mast cells revealed that only Dectin-2 mediates cys-LT production by Df, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Aspergillus famigatus. Lentiviral knockdown of Dectin-2 in BMDCs attenuated Df extract-elicited cys-LT generation, thereby identifying Dectin-2 as the receptor. Lung CD11c(+) cells, but not peritoneal or alveolar macrophages, also generated cys-LTs in response to Df. These findings place Dectin-2 among the C-type lectin receptors that activate arachidonic acid metabolism and identify the Dectin-2/FcR gamma/Syk/cys-LT axis as a novel mechanism by which three potent indoor allergens may activate innate immune cells to promote allergic inflammation.

Road traffic is a major source of fine PM (PM with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m; PM(2.5)). OBJECTIVE: We determined to characterize the influence of maternal exposure to atmospheric pollutants due to road traffic and urban activities on offspring term birth weight. METHODS: Women from a birth cohort [the LISA (Influences of Lifestyle Related Factors on the Human Immune System and Development of Allergies in Children) cohort] who delivered a non-premature baby with a birth weight > 2,500 g in Munich metropolitan area were included. We assessed PM(2.5), PM(2.5) absorbance (which depends on the blackness of PM(2.5), a marker of traffic-related air pollution), and nitrogen dioxide levels using a land-use regression model, taking into account the type and length of roads, population density, land coverage around the home address, and temporal variations in pollution during pregnancy. Using Poisson regression, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) of birth weight < 3,000 g, adjusted for gestational duration, sex, maternal smoking, height, weight, and education. RESULTS: Exposure was defined for 1,0 16 births. Taking the lowest quartile of exposure during pregnancy as a reference, the PR of birth weight < 3,000 g associated with the highest quartile was 1.7 for PM(2.5) [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.7], 1.8 for PM(2.5) absorbance (95% Cl, 1.1-2.7), and 1.2 for NO(2) (95% Cl, 0.7-1.7). The PR associated with an increase of 1 mu g/m(3) in PM(2.5) levels was 1. 13 (95% Cl, 1.00-1.29). CONCLUSION: Increases in PM(2.5) levels and PM(2.5) absorbance were associated with decreases in term birth weight. Traffic-related air pollutants may have adverse effects on birth weight.

Maternal antioxidant intake in pregnancy and wheezing illnesses in children at 2 y of age	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						asthma; diet; antioxidants; eczema; childhood; wheezing	ALLERGIC RHINITIS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HAY-FEVER; NATIONAL-HEALTH; DIETARY FACTORS; UNITED-STATES; LUNG-FUNCTION; T-CELLS; RISK	Background: Low intakes of dietary antioxidants may contribute to increases in asthma and allergy. Objective: We investigated the association of maternal total intakes (foods + supplements) of 10 antioxidant nutrients during pregnancy with wheezing and eczema in 2-y-old children. Design: Subjects were 1290 mother-child pairs in an ongoing cohort study. Maternal dietary and supplement intakes were assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire administered in the first and second trimesters. Antioxidant nutrient intakes were calculated. and the mean for each nutrient was considered to be the exposure during pregnancy. The outcomes of interest were any wheezing by the child during either the first or second year of life, recurrent wheezing in both years, and eczema in either the first or second year. Results: No association was observed between maternal total intake of any antioxidant nutrient and eczema. In multivariate logistic regression models, the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of maternal total intakes of vitamin E [odds ratio (OR): 0.70; 95% Cl: 0.48,1.03] and zinc (OR: 0.59; 95% Cl: 0.41, 0.88) was inversely associated with any wheezing at 2 y of age (P for trend = 0.06 and 0.01 over quartiles of intake for vitamin E and zinc, respectively). Similar results were obtained for recurrent wheezing at 2 y of age with vitamin E (OR: 0.49; 95% Cl: 0.27, 0.90) and zinc (OR: 0.49; 95% Cl: 0.27. 0.87) (P for trend = 0.05 and 0.06 over quartiles of intake for vitamin E and zinc, respectively). Conclusion: Our results suggest that higher maternal total intakes of antioxidants during pregnancy may decrease the risks for wheezing illnesses in early childhood.

Firstly, data relating to the relative skin sensitising potency of the chemical, and secondly, information regarding likely conditions of human exposure. During the past two decades, much has been achieved in terms of refining methods capable of informing these parameters. For example, the development of the local lymph node assay (LLNA) has made it possible to predict skin sensitising hazard, and to determine relative skin sensitising potency, in a way that was not possible previously. Taken together with accurate information about predicted exposure, such potency data can be used to facilitate the derivation of effective risk assessments. However, although the LLNA provides an integrated assessment of skin sensitising activity, it does require the use of experimental animals and there is growing enthusiasm for designing robust alternative approaches that will reduce or obviate that need. Progress is being made in defining alternative experimental strategies that avoid animal use, but it is clear that accurate characterisation of skin sensitisation hazards will require the effective integration of various sources of information. For this reason, we exemplify here one possible approach that, in theory, provides a framework for not only the identification of skin sensitising chemicals, but also the estimation of relative sensitising potency. This paradigm depends upon development of an understanding of the various biological, biochemical and chemical factors that impact on the allergenic properties of chemicals and the acquisition of skin sensitisation, and an ability to measure these in vitro.

However, it is unknown how platelets induce pulmonary leukocyte recruitment in asthma. Here, we have investigated the importance of platelet adhesion molecule expression on pulmonary eosinophil and lymphocyte recruitment and on leukocyte CD11b and very late antigen (VLA)-4 expression in mice. Pulmonary leukocyte recruitment in platelet-depleted mice (sensitized and exposed to ovalbumin) transfused with fixed, unstimulated platelets (FUSPs) was abolished, whereas transfusion with platelets stimulated and fixed (FSPs), expressing P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), restored eosinophil and lymphocyte recruitment. Transfusion with platelets from P-selectin-deficient mice, or with FSPs stimulated in the presence of a blocking anti-P-selectin antibody, were unable to restore pulmonary leukocyte recruitment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed increased expression of CD11b and VLA-4 on leukocytes attached to platelets after allergen exposure, and CD11b expression on leukocytes was suppressed in thrombocytopenic mice but was restored with the transfusion of FSPs, but not FUSPs, a phenomenon concurrent with the formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes. P-selectin expression on the surfaces of platelets is a major requirement for pulmonary eosinophil and lymphocyte recruitment, allowing circulating platelets to bind to and stimulate leukocytes for endothelial attachment.

Antibiotics also lead to overgrowth of the yeast Candida albicans, which can secrete potent prostaglandin-like immune response modulators. We have developed a mouse model of antibiotic-induced microbiota disruption that includes stable increases in gastrointestinal (GI) enteric bacteria and GI Candida levels with no introduction of microbes into the lungs. Mice are treated for 5 days with cefoperazone in the drinking water, followed by a single oral gavage of C albicans. This results in alterations of GI bacterial populations and increased yeast numbers in the GI microbiota for at least 2 to 3 weeks and can drive the development of a CD4 T-cell-mediated allergic airway response to subsequent mold spore (Aspergillus fumigatus) exposure in immunocompetent mice without previous systemic antigen priming. The allergic response in the lungs is characterized by increased levels of eosinophils, mast cells, interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, gamma interferon, immunoglobulin E, and mucus-secreting cells. In the absence of antibiotics, mice exposed to Aspergillus spores do not develop an allergic response in the airways. This study provides the first experimental evidence to support a role for antibiotics and fungal microbiota in promoting the development of allergic airway disease. In addition, these studies also highlight the concept that events in distal mucosal sites such as the GI tract can play an important role in regulating immune responses in the lungs.

An immune etiology has been postulated, though the nature of this is unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the role of T cells in lamotrigine hypersensitivity. Methods: A lymphocyte transformation test was performed on 4 hypersensitive patients. Lymphocytes from 3 of 4 lamotrigine-hypersensitive patients proliferated when stimulated with lamotrigine. T-cell clones were generated from one patient to further characterize the nature of the T-cell involvement. Cells were characterized in terms of their phenotype, functionality, and mechanisms of antigen presentation and cytotoxicity. Results: Of the 44 drug-specific T-cell clones generated, most were CD4(+) with occasional CD8(+) cells. All clones expressed the up T-cell receptor; several Vbeta 5.1(+) or 9(+) T-cell clones were generated. All clones also expressed the skin-homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte antigen. Lamotrigine-stimulated T cells were cytotoxic and secreted perforin, IFN-gamma, IL-5, and macrophage inflammatory protein la, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, RANTES, and I-309. Lamotrigine was present on HLA-DR and HLA-DQ by antigen-presenting cells in the absence of drug metabolism and processing. The T-cell receptor of certain clones could accommodate analogs of lamotrigine, but no cross-reactivity was seen with other anticonvulsants. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of some lamotrigine-hypersensitivity reactions. The identification of drug-specific cells that express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and type 1 cytokines after T-cell receptor activation is consistent with the clinical symptoms. Furthermore, identification of large numbers of Vbeta 5.1(+) T cells suggests that polymorphisms within T-cell receptor genes might act as determinants of susceptibility.

However, some asthmatics develop irreversible airway obstruction, probably as a result of airway remodelling. Methods: After 21-33 years, 228 adults (aged 13-44 years at baseline) with a history of asthma were re-examined to assess risk factors for the development of irreversible airway obstruction (IAO, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <80% predicted and reversibility <9% predicted) and a reduced postbronchodilator transfer coefficient (carbon monoxide transfer factor/alveolar volume, <80% predicted), both characteristics of COPD. Results: At follow up, 41% did not have airway obstruction (NAO), 43% had reversible airway obstruction (RAO), and 16% had IAO; 23% had a reduced transfer coefficient. Patients with RAO had asthma-like characteristics (wheezing, asthma attacks, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)) while patients with IAO had COPD-like symptoms (cough, phlegm, dyspnoea) at follow up. The development of IAO is determined by a lower FEV1, less reversibility of airway obstruction and, surprisingly, less severe BHR at initial screening. Eighty percent of the patients with asthma who used anti-inflammatory medication still had airway obstruction, but IAO developed less frequently. Smoking was associated with a reduced transfer coefficient but not with the development of IAO. Female sex was associated with a reduced transfer coefficient, whereas corticosteroid use was not. Conclusions: Although IAO and a low transfer coefficient are both characteristics of COPD, they represent distinct entities in adult asthmatics in terms of symptomatology, aetiology, and probably in therapeutic approaches and disease prevention.

Since that time, many of the details of the inflammatory cascade underlying allergy and asthma have been elucidated, and IgE is now known to play a key upstream role. The goals of this report are to review the cellular and molecular events set in motion by IgE and to examine the evidence for its participation in both the immediate allergic response and the late-phase or chronic inflammatory response in the skin and lungs.

A quantitative analysis of 19 selected fragrances was performed by GC-MS. Further analysis of GC-MS data revealed the presence of 43 other fragrance chemicals/groups of fragrance chemicals in the products investigated. Among the 19 target substances the most commonly detected were limonene in 78%, linalool in 61% and citronellol in 47% of the products investigated. The FM ingredients were present in these products with the following frequencies: oak moss (evernic acid methylester) 2%, cinnamic, alcohol 2%, cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamal) 3%, isoeugenol 5%, alpha -amylcinnamic aldehyde (amyl cinnamal) 8%, hydroxycitronellal 12%, eugenol 27%, and geraniol 41%. Thus, the chemical analyses of domestic and occupational products indicates that investigation of potential contact allergy related to these products types should consider fragrance allergens additional to those in the FM, since these may occur with high frequency.

Costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 expressed by DCs, the polarizing cytokine environment during DC-T-cell interaction, and also the nature of the antigen are critical in the orientation of the immune response. In this study, the effect of the cysteine protease Der p 1, one of the major allergens of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides, pteronyssinus, on these different parameters was evaluated comparatively on monocyte-derived DCs obtained from healthy donors, from pollen-sensitive patients, or from patients sensitive to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Results showed that Der p 1 induced an increase in CD86 expression only on DCs from house dust mite-sensitive patients. This was also associated with a higher capacity to induce T-cell proliferation, a rapid increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and the type 2 cytokine IL-10. No changes in the release of IL-12 p70 were induced by Der p 1. Finally, purified T cells from house dust mite-sensitive patients stimulated by autologous Der p 1-pulsed DCs preferentially produced IL-4 rather than interferon-gamma. These effects were abolished ih the presence of the inactive precursor of Der p 1 (ProDer p 1). Taken together, these data suggest that DCs from house dust mite-sensitive patients, in contrast to DCs from healthy donors and from pollen-sensitive patients, exposed to Der p 1 play a pivotal role in the enhancement of the Th2 response associated with the allergic reaction developed in response to house dust mite exposure.

Dendritic cells (DCs) produce cytokines that promote naive CD4(+) T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and inducible T regulatory (iTreg) cells. However, the initiation of Th2 cell responses remains poorly understood, although it is likely that more than one mechanism might be involved. Here we have defined a specific DC subset that is involved in Th2 cell differentiation in vivo in response to a protease allergen, as well as infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. We have demonstrated that this subset is controlled by the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is required for their differentiation and Th2 cell-inducing function. IRF4 is known to control Th2 cell differentiation and Th2 cell-associated suppressing function in Treg cells. Our finding suggests that IRF4 also plays a role in DCs where it controls the initiation of Th2 cell responses.

However, results are inconsistent, and the hypothesized intermediate role of the microbiota in the association between birth mode and atopic manifestations has not been studied yet. Objectives: We sought to investigate the relationship between microbiota composition, mode and place of delivery, and atopic manifestations. Methods: The Child, Parent and Health: Lifestyle and Genetic Constitution Birth Cohort Study included data on birth characteristics, lifestyle factors, and atopic manifestations collected through repeated questionnaires from birth until age 7 years. Fecal samples were collected at age 1 month (n = 1176) to determine microbiota composition, and blood samples were collected at ages 1 (n = 921), 2 (n = 822), and 6 to 7 (n = 384) years to determine specific IgE levels. Results: Colonization by Clostridium difficile at age 1 month was associated with wheeze and eczema throughout the first 6 to 7 years of life and with asthma at age 6 to 7 years. Vaginal home delivery compared with vaginal hospital delivery was associated with a decreased risk of eczema, sensitization to food allergens, and asthma. After stratification for parental history of atopy, the decreased risk of sensitization to food allergens (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.77) and asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.77) among vaginally home-born infants was only found for children with atopic parents. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of mode and place of delivery on atopic outcomes were mediated by C difficile colonization. Conclusion: Mode and place of delivery affect the gastrointestinal microbiota composition, which subsequently influences the risk of atopic manifestations. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:948-55.)

Earlier floral anthesis has been suggested, in turn, to have a role in human disease by increasing time of exposure to pollen that causes allergic rhinitis and related asthma. However, earlier floral initiation does not necessarily alter the temporal duration of the pollen season, and, to date, no consistent continental trend in pollen season length has been demonstrated. Here we report that duration of the ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen season has been increasing in recent decades as a function of latitude in North America. Latitudinal effects on increasing season length were associated primarily with a delay in first frost of the fall season and lengthening of the frost free period. Overall, these data indicate a significant increase in the length of the ragweed pollen season by as much as 13-27 d at latitudes above similar to 44 degrees N since 1995. This is consistent with recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections regarding enhanced warming as a function of latitude. If similar warming trends accompany long-term climate change, greater exposure times to seasonal allergens may occur with subsequent effects on public health.

Objective: We studied the sensitization profile of individual allergens (major, minor and pan-allergens) in pollen-sensitized patients in a region with high exposure to olive pollen by investigating the influence of minor allergens on allergic disease and the association between pan- and minor allergen sensitizations. Methods: A panel of 13 purified allergens, which included the most relevant allergens in the area, as well as minor olive allergens and pan-allergens, were screened using a high-capacity technology (ADVIA-Centaur((R))) in 891 patients. Results: Olive allergy as measured by specific IgE to Ole e 1 was the leading pollinosis in the area. The minor olive allergens Ole e 7 and Ole e 9 were markers of more severe allergic illness. Profilin sensitization was associated mainly with grass allergy, the second most prevalent pollinosis. Salsola kali pollen allergy was the third most common cause of pollinosis in the area. The prevalence of sensitization to the peach allergen Pru p 3, a nonspecific lipid-transfer protein, was notable. Conclusion: Epidemiological analysis by component-resolved diagnosis is a new method, which elucidates the interaction between allergen exposure gradient and patient sensitization. High exposure leads to differential sensitization profiles some of which are associated with more severe allergic conditions. Profilin sensitization, related mainly to grass pollinosis, was a marker of more severe grass pollen sensitization.

However, little is known about the cortical processing of the perception of dyspnea. Objectives: To investigate the cortical areas associated with the processing of the affective unpleasantness of perceived dyspnea. Methods: Brain imaging study using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 14 healthy volunteers. Measurements and Main Results: Dyspnea was induced by inspiratory resistive loaded breathing with concomitant positive and negative emotional stimulation by viewing standardized emotional picture series. The blood oxygen level-dependent contrast was measured as an index of local neuronal activity while respiration was continuously monitored. Negative emotional stimulation during loaded breathing was associated with higher unpleasantness of perceived dyspnea when compared with loaded breathing with concomitant positive emotional stimulation (P < 0.05). The levels of intensity of perceived dyspnea, respiratory responses, and load magnitude were similar between both conditions. Higher unpleasantness of dyspnea was associated with neuronal activations in the limbic system-that is, in the right anterior insula and in the right amygdala (respective Z values = 3.93 and 3.15; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results of the present brain imaging study suggest that the unpleasantness of subjectively perceived dyspnea is processed in the right human anterior insula and amygdala.

Objective: To assess the effect of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in children with atopic dermatitis. Methods: Children age 5 to 16 years with atopic dermatitis (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD] > 7) and sensitization to dust mites alone, without food allergy or chronic asthma, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and stratified according to disease severity. SLIT or placebo was given for 18 months in addition to standard therapy. SCORAD, visual analog scale, and rescue medication consumption were recorded at 3-month intervals. Results: Fifty-six children were enrolled, and 28 were allocated to SLIT. Forty-eight completed the study, with 2 dropouts in the active and 6 in the placebo group. The difference from baseline in the SCORAD was significant (P = .025) between the 2 groups starting from month 9. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the use of medications only in the active group. A trend toward significance was seen for the visual analog score only in the active group versus baseline (P = .07). A significant difference in the considered parameters was found only in patients with a mild-moderate disease, whereas severe patients had only a marginal benefit. SLIT had to be discontinued in 2 patients because of exacerbation of dermatitis. Conclusion: Sublingual immunotherapy to dust mite improves mild-moderate atopic dermatitis. Clinical implications: Sublingual immunotherapy may represent an additional therapeutic tool for the treatment of extrinsic atopic dermatitis in properly selected children.

Maternal fish intake during pregnancy and atopy and asthma in infancy	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						asthma; atopy; children; fish intake; n-3 PUFA; pregnancy	POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; OIL SUPPLEMENTATION; ALLERGIC DISEASE; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-A; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HIGH-RISK; CHILDHOOD; CONSUMPTION; RESPONSES; LIFE	Background: There is growing evidence that n-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and may modulate immune response. Dietary intake of these nutrients during pregnancy could play a role in the risk of asthma and atopy in the offspring. Methods: Using data from a cohort of women (n=462) enrolled during pregnancy and whose offspring were followed up to 6 years, we evaluated the impact of fish consumption during pregnancy on the incidence of atopy and asthma. Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire (42 items) applied by an interviewer. Results: Thirty-four percent of infants had a medical diagnosis of eczema at age 1 year, 14.3% of the children were atopic [based on skin prick test (SPT) at 6 years], and 5.7% had atopic wheeze at age 6 years. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, fish intake during pregnancy was protective against the risk of eczema at age 1 year, a positive SPT for house dust mite at age 6 years and atopic wheeze at age 6 years [odds ratio (OR)=0.73 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.98, OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01 and OR=0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.96, respectively]. For an increase in fish intake from once per week to 2.5 times per week, the risk of eczema at age 1 year decreased by 37%, and the risk of positive SPT at age 6 years by 35%. Stratification by breastfeeding showed that fish intake was significantly related to a decrease risk in persistent wheeze among non-breastfed children (P for interaction < 0.05). No protective effect was observed among breastfed children. Conclusion: Our data suggest a protective effect of fish intake during pregnancy on the risk of atopy-related outcomes.

Intestinal helminths protect in a murine model of asthma	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							REGULATORY T-CELLS; INDUCED AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; CYTOKINE PRODUCTION; INTERLEUKIN-10-DEFICIENT MICE; CPG OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; INVERSE ASSOCIATION; HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS; TH2 RESPONSES; HAY-FEVER	Underdeveloped nations are relatively protected from the worldwide asthma epidemic; the hygiene hypothesis suggests this is due to suppression of Th2-mediated inflammation by increased exposure to pathogens and their products. Although microbial exposures can promote Th2-suppressing Th1 responses, even Th2-skewing infections, such as helminths, appear to suppress atopy, suggesting an alternate explanation for these observations. To investigate whether induction of regulatory responses by helminths may counter allergic inflammation, we examined the effects of helminth infection in a murine model of atopic asthma. We chose Heligosomoides polygyrus, a gastrointestinal nematode, as the experimental helminth; this worm does not enter the lung in its life cycle. We found that H. polygyrus infection suppressed allergen-induced airway eosinophilia, bronchial hyperreactivity, and in vitro allergen-recall Th2 responses in an IL-10-dependent manner; total and OVA-specific IgE, however, were increased by worm infection. Finally, helminth-infected mice were protected against eosinophilic inflammation induced by adoptive transfer of OVA-stimulated CD4(+) cells, and transfer of cells from helminth-infected/OVA-exposed mice suppressed OVA-induced eosinophilic inflammation, suggesting a role for regulatory cells. Increased CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells were found in thoracic lymph nodes of helminth-infected/OVA-exposed mice. Helminthic colonization appears to protect against asthma and atopic disorders; the regulatory cytokine, IL-10, may be a critical player.

A precise definition of asthma phenotypes is now becoming more and more important, not only for a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, but in particular to ascertain the specific genes associated with these phenotypes. Recent findings In children, three asthma phenotypes are now well defined: transient infant wheezing, nonatopic wheezing of the toddler, and IgE-mediated wheezing/asthma. Recently, a fourth phenotype, late-onset childhood asthma has been added to this list. In adults, asthma persisting from childhood into adulthood should be distinguished from asthma starting in adulthood. The phenotypes of adult-onset asthma are still poorly defined. Until now, phenotypic classification has been based primarily on etiologic factors (eg, aspirin sensitivity, persistent respiratory infections, occupational factors, or toxic exposures) or clinical characteristics of the disease (eg, mild, severe, brittle, near fatal, with fixed airflow obstruction, steroid resistant). Novel noninvasive techniques to assess the type and severity of airway inflammation and dysfunction are increasingly used to identify better the different phenotypes. Summary The classic phenotype of IgE-mediated asthma starting in childhood is now clearly defined. However, many other phenotypes of asthma in childhood as well in adulthood are being recognized. In particular, asthma starting in adulthood and noneosinophilic asthma constitute an important part of the adult asthma population, and are,still poorly defined. A precise definition of these asthma phenotypes is urgently needed because they are likely to be associated with different genotypes, responses to treatment, and prognoses.

We conducted a panel study of 22 Hispanic children with asthma who were 10-16 years old and living in a Los Angeles community with high traffic density. Subjects filled out symptom diaries daily for up to 3 months (November 1999 through January 2000). Pollutants included ambient hourly values of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, Sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide and 24-hr values of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 &mu;m (PM10), and elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) PM10 fractions. Asthma symptom severity was regressed on pollutants using generalized estimating equations, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) was regressed on pollutants using mixed models. We found positive associations of symptoms with criteria air pollutants (O-3, NO2, SO2, PM10),, EC-OC, and VOCs (benzene, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, 1,3-butadiene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene). Selected adjusted odds ratios for bothersome or more severe asthma symptoms from interquartile range increases in pollutants were, for 1.4 ppb 8-hr NO2, 1.27 [95% confidence interval (Cl), 1.05-1-54]; 1.00 ppb benzene, 1.23 (95% Cl, 1.02-1.48); 3.16 ppb formaldehyde, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.04-1.80); 37 &mu;g/m(3) PM,0, 1.45 (95% Cl, 1.11-1.90); 2.91 &mu;g/m(3) EC, 1.85 (95% Cl, 1.11-3.08); and 4.64 &mu;g/m(3) OC, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.12-3.17). Two-pollutant models of EC or OC with PM10 showed little change in odds ratios for EC (to 1.83) or OC (to 1.89), but PM10 decreased from 1.45 to 1.0. There were no significant associations with PEF. Findings support the view that air toxics in the pollutant mix from traffic and industrial sources may have adverse effects on asthma in children.

Objective: We investigated the longitudinal effects of exposure to house dust endotoxin (HDE), allergen levels, and the presence of a dog in the home on wheezing in young children over a 4-year period. Methods: Two hundred twenty-six children younger than 5 years were followed for 4 years. Endotoxin and allergen levels were measured from house dust collected at baseline. Longitudinal associations were investigated by using a proportional hazards technique that allowed for multiple outcomes per subject. Results: Exposure to high concentrations of HDE of greater than the median level was associated with an increased risk for wheezing over the period of observation (multivariate relative risk, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.07-2.14), but this risk rapidly decreased over time (P for trend = .005). Exposure to cockroach allergen was associated with increased risk for wheezing, whereas exposure to cat allergen and the presence of a dog in the home were both associated with decreased risk for wheezing. The risks associated with cockroach allergen, cat allergen, and dog did not change over the period of observation. Conclusion: The negative associations between exposures to dogs and cat allergen and wheeze appear to be independent of the effects of endotoxin and suggest that separate mechanisms might mediate the effects of HDE exposure and pet exposure on the developing immune system.

We have recently shown that ibudilast, which has been used for bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disorders, attenuated the H2O2-induced apoptosis of astrocytes via the cGMP signaling pathway. This study examines the mechanism underlying the protective effect of cGMP. The membrane-permeable cGMP analog dibutyryl-cGMP attenuated the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, DNA ladder formation, nuclear condensation, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation in cultured astrocytes. These effects of dibutyryl-cGMP were almost completely inhibited by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor KT5823. In isolated rat brain mitochondria, cGMP in the presence of cytosolic extract from astrocytes inhibited the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) as determined by monitoring Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling. This ability of the cytosolic extract was inactivated by heat treatment and was mimicked by exogenous PKG. The effect of cGMP on the mitochondrial swelling was blocked by KT5823. The PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability and caspase-3 activation. These findings demonstrate that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP via the activation of PKG, and the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to its anti-apoptotic effect.

It has been suggested that the effects of particulate matter may be due to particles in the ultrafine (0.01-0.1 mum) size range. Be-cause previous studies on ultrafine particles only used self-monitored peak expiratory now rate (PEFR), we assessed the associations between particle mars and number concentrations in several size ranges measured at a central site and measured (biweekly) spirometric lung function among a group of 54 adult asthmatics (n = 495 measurements). We also compared results to daily morning, afternoon, and evening PEFR measurements done at home (n = 7,672-8,110 measurements), The median (maximum) 24 hr number concentrations were 14,500/cm(3) (46,500/cm(3)) ultrafine particles and 800/cm(3) (2,800/cm3) accumulation mode (0.1-1 mum) particles. The median (maximum) mass concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter <2.5 <mu>m) and PM10 (particulate matter <10 <mu>m in aerodynamic diameter) were 8.4 mug/m(3) (38.3 mug/m(3)) and 13.5 mug/m(3) (73.7 mug/m(3)), respectively. The number of accumulation mode particles was consistently inversely associated with PEFR in spirometry. Inverse, but nonsignificant, associations were observed with ultrafine particles, and no associations were observed with large particles (PM10). Compared to the effect estimates for self-monitored PEFR, the effect estimates for spirometric PEFR tended to be larger. The standard errors were also larger, probably due to the lower number of spirometric measurements. The present results support the need to monitor the particle number and size distributions in urban air in addition to mass.

Little is known about the relationship between airway responsiveness in infancy and the development of asthma later in life. The relationship of airway responsiveness at 1 mo with asthma, atopy, lower respiratory symptoms, and lung function at 6 yr of age was investigated prospectively in 95 white children from a randomly ascertained birth cohort. Baseline spirometry, airway responsiveness to histamine, and skin reactivity to common allergens were assessed at the age of 1 mo and 6 yr. Total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) was measured from cord blood and at 6 yr. Brood eosinophil counts were measured at 6 yr only. Family, symptom, and exposure histories at both time points were derived from questionnaire data. Independently of the other factors assessed, increased airway responsiveness at 1 mo was significantly associated with the following parameters measured at six yr: decreased FEV1 (p < 0.001); decreased FVC (p < 0.001); physician-diagnosed asthma (p < 0.001); and lower respiratory tract symptoms (p < 0.05). None of the other physiologic factors measured in infancy showed such consistent associations with important clinical and physiologic outcomes at age 6.

Long-term Ambient Fine Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Lung Cancer in a Large Cohort of Never-Smokers	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						fine particulate matter air pollution; lung neoplasms; never-smokers; asthma; pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE DAMAGE; HEALTH IMPACTS; NORWEGIAN MEN; FOLLOW-UP; MORTALITY; RISK; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; INTERVENTIONS	Rationale: There is compelling evidence that acute and chronic exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution increases cardiopulmonary mortality. However, the role of PM2.5 in the etiology of lung cancer is less clear, particularly at concentrations that prevail in developed countries and in never-smokers. Objectives: This study examined the association between mean long-term ambient PM2.5 concentrations and lung cancer mortality among 188,699 lifelong never-smokers drawn from the nearly 1.2 million Cancer Prevention Study-II participants enrolled by the American Cancer Society in 1982 and followed prospectively through 2008. Methods: Mean metropolitan statistical area PM2.5 concentrations were determined for each participant based on central monitoring data. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer mortality in relation to PM2.5. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,100 lung cancer deaths were observed during the 26-year follow-up period. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentrations was associated with a 15-27% increase in lung cancer mortality. The association between PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality was similar in men and women and across categories of attained age and educational attainment, but was stronger in those with a normal body mass index and a history of chronic lung disease at enrollment (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The present findings strengthen the evidence that ambient concentrations of PM2.5 measured in recent decades are associated with small but measurable increases in lung cancer mortality.

PCP are generally applied to human skin and mainly produce local exposure, although skin penetration or use in the oral cavity, on the face, lips, eyes and mucosa may also produce human systemic exposure. In the EU, US and Japan, the safety of PCP is regulated under cosmetic and/or drug regulations. Oxidative hair dyes contain arylamines, the most chemically reactive ingredients of PCP. Although arylamines have an allergic potential, taking into account the high number of consumers exposed, the incidence and prevalence of hair dye allergy appears to be low and stable. A recent (2001) epidemiology study suggested an association of oxidative hair dye use and increased bladder cancer risk in consumers, although this was not confirmed by subsequent or previous epidemiologic investigations. The results of genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies Suggest that modern hair dyes and their ingredients pose no genotoxic, carcinogenic or reproductive risk. Recent reports suggest that arylamines contained in oxidative hair dyes are N-acetylated in human or mammalian skin resulting in systemic exposure to traces of detoxified, i.e. non-genotoxic, metabolites, whereas human hepatocytes were unable to transform hair dye arylamines to potentially carcinogenic metabolites. An expert panel of the International Agency on Research of Cancer (IARC) concluded that there is no evidence for a causal association of hair dye exposure with an elevated cancer risk in consumers. Ultraviolet filters have important benefits by protecting the consumer against adverse effects of UV radiation; these substances undergo a stringent safety evaluation under current international regulations prior to their marketing. Concerns were also raised about the safety of solid nanoparticles in PCP, mainly TiO(2) and ZnO in Sunscreens. However, current evidence suggests that these particles are non-toxic, do not penetrate into or through normal or compromised human skin and, therefore, pose no risk to human health. The increasing use of natural plant ingredients in personal care products raised new safety issues that require novel approaches to their safety evaluation similar to those of plant-derived food ingredients. For example, the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a promising tool to assess the safety of substances present at trace levels as well as minor ingredients of plant-derived substances. The potential human systemic exposure to PCP ingredients is increasingly estimated on the basis of in vitro skin penetration data. However, new evidence suggests that the in vitro test may overestimate human systemic exposure to PCP ingredients due to the absence of metabolism in cadaver skin or misclassification of skin residues that, in vivo, remain in the stratum corneum or hair follicle openings, i.e. outside the living skin. Overall, today's safety assessment of PCP and their ingredients is not only based on science, but also on their respective regulatory status as well as other issues, such as the ethics of animal testing. Nevertheless, the record shows that today's PCP are safe and offer multiple benefits to quality of life and health of the consumer. In the interest of all stakeholders, consumers, regulatory bodies and producers, there is an urgent need for an international harmonization on the status and safety requirements of these products and their ingredients.

The diagnosis of this condition is difficult because none of the typical signs are pathognomonic. Sets of criteria have been proposed but are mainly used to include dogs in clinical studies. The goals of the present study were to characterize the clinical features and signs of a large population of dogs with CAD, to identify which of these characteristics could be different in food-induced atopic dermatitis (FIAD) and non-food-induced atopic dermatitis (NFIAD) and to develop criteria for the diagnosis of this condition. Using simulated annealing, selected criteria were tested on a large and geographically widespread population of pruritic dogs. The study first described the signalment, history and clinical features of a large population of CAD dogs, compared FIAD and NFIAD dogs and confirmed that both conditions are clinically indistinguishable. Correlations of numerous clinical features with the diagnosis of CAD are subsequently calculated, and two sets of criteria associated with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 80% to 85% and from 79% to 85%, respectively, are proposed. It is finally demonstrated that these new sets of criteria provide better sensitivity and specificity, when compared to Willemse and Prelaud criteria. These criteria can be applied to both FIAD and NFIAD dogs.

Their differential contributions to lung function growth in the general children's population are less clear. Objective: To study the relative impact of pre- and postnatal exposure on respiratory functions of primary school children in a wide range of geographic settings, we analyzed flow and volume data of more than 20,000 children (aged 6-12 yr) from nine countries in Europe and North America. Methods: Exposure information had been obtained by comparable questionnaires, and spirometry followed a protocol of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Linear and logistic regressions were used, controlling for individual risk factors and study area. Heterogeneity between study-specific results and mean effects were estimated using meta-analytic tools. Main Results: Smoking during pregnancy was associated with decreases in lung function parameters between -1% (FEV1) and -6% maximal expiratory flow at 25% of vital capacity left (MEF25). A 4% lower maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF) corresponded to a 40% increase in the risk of poor lung function (MMEF < 75% of expected). Associations with current passive smoking were weaker though still measurable, with effects ranging from -0.5% (FEV1) to -2% maximal expiratory flow (MEF50). Conclusions: Considering the high number of children exposed to maternal smoking in utero and the even higher number exposed to passive smoking after birth, this risk factor for reduced lung function growth remains a serious pediatric and public health issue.

While low-dose challenge trials have been conducted on an appreciable number of allergic individuals, a variety of different clinical protocols were used making the estimation of the threshold dose very difficult. Objective A roundtable conference was convened to develop a consensus clinical protocol for low-dose challenge trials for the estimation of threshold doses for specific allergenic foods. Methods In May 2002, 20 clinical allergists and other interested parties were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to develop consensus of the key elements of a clinical protocol for low-dose challenge trials. Results A consensus protocol was developed. Patients with convincing histories of food allergies and supporting diagnostic evidence including past challenge trials or high CAP-RAST scores can be enrolled in low-dose challenge trials. Care must be taken with younger patients to assure that they have not outgrown their food allergy. An approach was developed for the medication status of patients entering such trials. Challenge materials must be standardized, for example, partially defatted peanut flour composed of equal amounts of the three major varieties of peanuts (Florunner, Virginia, Spanish). Challenge materials must be appropriately blinded with sensory evaluation used to confirm the adequacy of blinding. A double-blind, placebo-controlled design should be used for low-dose challenge trials. Low-dose challenge trials would begin at doses of 10 mug of the allergenic food and would continue with doses of 100 mug and 1 mg followed by specific higher doses up to 100 mg depending upon the expert judgement of the physician; even higher doses might be applied to assure that the patient is indeed reactive to the particular food. A 30-min time interval would be used between doses, and reactive doses would be expressed as both discrete and cumulative doses. The goal of each challenge would be to develop objective symptoms; trials should not be discontinued on the basis of subjective symptoms only. Statistically, a minimum of 29 patients would be enrolled in low-dose challenge trials for each allergenic food because 0 reactors out of 29 patients at a particular dose allow the conclusion that there is 95% certainty that 90% of allergic individuals will not react to that dose. Conclusion A consensus protocol was developed. Using this protocol, it will be possible to estimate threshold doses for allergenic foods, the lowest amount that elicits mild, objective symptoms in highly sensitive individuals.

Acid-induced asthma appears in association with gastroesophageal reflux after accidental inhalation of acid (fog, pollution, and workplace exposure) and in the presence of altered airway pH homeostasis. Endogenous and exogenous exposures to acids evoke cough, bronchoconstriction, airway hyperreactivity, microvascular leakage, and heightened production of mucous, fluid, and nitric oxide. Abnormal acidity of the airways is reflected in exhaled breath assays. The intimate mechanisms of acid-induced airway obstruction are dependent on activation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves. Protons activate these nerves with the subsequent release of tachykinins (major mediators of this pathway) that, in conjunction with kinins, nitric oxide, oxygen radicals, and proteases, modulate diverse aspects of airway dysfunction and inflammation. The recognition that acid stress might initiate or exacerbate airway obstructive symptomatology has prompted the consideration of new therapies targeting pH homeostasis.

Symptoms, assessed yearly by questionnaire from 1996 to 1999, were associated with the yearly variability of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mum (odds ratio [OR] 1.09/mug/m(3); 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.17), OC (OR 1.41/mug/m(3); 95% CI 1.12-1.78), NO2 (OR 1.07/ppb; 95% CI 1.02-1.13), and ozone (OR 1.06/ppb; 95% Cl 1.00-1.12). The ORs associated with yearly within-community variability in air pollution were larger than the effect of the between-community 4-year average concentrations. In two pollutant models, the effects of yearly variation in OC and NO2 were only modestly reduced by adjusting for other pollutants, except in a model containing both OC and NO2; the effects of all other pollutants were reduced after adjusting for OC or NO2. We conclude that OC and NO2 deserve greater attention as potential causes of the chronic symptoms of bronchitis in children with asthma and that previous cross-sectional studies may have underestimated the risks associated with air pollution.

The prodrug L-N-6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine 5-tetrazole amide (SC-51) is rapidly converted in vivo to the active metabolite L-N-6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL). Initially, we performed in vitro experiments in human primary airway epithelial cells to demonstrate that L-NIL causes inhibition of iNOS. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, SC-51 was administered as a single oral dose (20 or 200 mg) in separate cohorts of healthy volunteers (two groups of n=12) and mild asthmatic patients (two groups of n=12). SC-51 (200 mg) reduced exhaled breath NO levels to <2 ppb in both healthy volunteers (P<0.001) and mild asthmatics (P<0.001) within 15 min, representing >90% inhibition of baseline levels of NO in asthmatic patients, with the effects lasting at least 72 h. There were no significant effects on blood pressure, pulse rate, or respiratory function (FEV1). This study demonstrates that an inhibitor of iNOS produces marked inhibition of exhaled breath NO in normal and asthmatic subjects without producing the side effects observed following the systemic administration of non-selective NOS inhibitors, and thus provides support for the potential use of iNOS inhibitors to treat a range of inflammatory clinical disorders.

Furthermore, there is evidence that endotoxin exposure during early life is protective against the development of atopy and asthma, although this relationship remains poorly understood. It is therefore possible that genetic variation in the TLR4 locus contributes to asthma susceptibility. In this study we characterize the genetic diversity in the TLR4 locus and test for association between the common genetic variants and asthma-related phenotypes. In a cohort of 90 ethnically diverse subjects, we resequenced the TLR4 locus and identified a total of 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We assessed five common polymorphisms for evidence of association with asthma in two large family-based cohorts: a heterogeneous North American cohort (589 families), and a more homogenous population from northeastern Quebec, Canada (167 families). Using the transmission-disequilibrum test, we found no evidence of association for any of the polymorphisms tested, including two functional variants. Furthermore, we found no evidence for association between the TLR4 variants and four quantitative intermediate asthma- and atopy-related phenotypes. Based on these results, we found no evidence that genetic variation in TLR4 contributes to asthma susceptibility.

Our objective was a) to describe the allergen sensitivities, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, and home environmental characteristics of a national sample of inner-city children with moderate to severe asthma and b) to develop and implement a multifaceted, home-based comprehensive intervention to reduce home allergens and ETS, tailored to the specific sensitization and exposure profiles of those children. Allergen skin testing and a home evaluation were performed to determine the presence of ETS and factors known to be associated with increased indoor allergen levels. Based on published remediation techniques, a home environmental intervention, organized into modules, each addressing one of five specific allergen groups or ETS, was designed. Of 994 allergic children from seven U.S. urban communities, 937 successfully completed baseline interviews and home allergen surveys and were enrolled. More than 50% of children had positive skin tests to three or more allergen groups. Cockroaches were reported in 58% of homes, wall-to-wall carpeting in the child's bedroom in 55%, a smoker in 48%, mice or rats in 40%, and furry pets in 28%. More than 60% of enrolled families received four or more modules, and between 94% and 98% of all modules were completed. We conclude that most inner-city children with moderate to severe asthma are sensitized to multiple indoor allergens and that environmental factors known to be associated with asthma severity are commonly present in their homes. The intervention developed for the Inner-City Asthma Study employs accepted methods to address an array of allergens and ETS exposure while ensuring that the intervention is tailored to the specific sensitization profiles and home characteristics of these children.

Since the effects of IL-33 on DCs remain controversial, we investigated the ability of IL-33 to modulate DC functions in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that IL-33 activates myeloid DCs to produce IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF, CCL17 and to express high levels of CD40, CD80 OX40L and CCR7. Importantly, IL-33-activated DCs prime naive lymphocytes to produce the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, but not IL-4. In vivo, IL-33 exposure induces DC recruitment and activation in the lung. Using an OVA-induced allergic lung inflammation model, we demonstrate that the reduced airway inflammation in ST2-deficient mice correlates with the failure in DC activation and migration to the draining LN. Finally, we show that adoptive transfer of IL-33-activated DCs exacerbates lung inflammation in a DC-driven model of allergic airway inflammation. These data demonstrate for the first time that IL-33 activates DCs during antigen presentation and thereby drives a Th2-type response in allergic lung inflammation.

Clinical effects of sulphite additives	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review							METABISULFITE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION; DIOXIDE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION; ALLERGIC CONTACT-DERMATITIS; CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; SODIUM METABISULFITE; SULFUR-DIOXIDE; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY; BRONCHODILATOR SOLUTIONS; INHALED METABISULFITE	P>Sulphites are widely used as preservative and antioxidant additives in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Topical, oral or parenteral exposure to sulphites has been reported to induce a range of adverse clinical effects in sensitive individuals, ranging from dermatitis, urticaria, flushing, hypotension, abdominal pain and diarrhoea to life-threatening anaphylactic and asthmatic reactions. Exposure to the sulphites arises mainly from the consumption of foods and drinks that contain these additives; however, exposure may also occur through the use of pharmaceutical products, as well as in occupational settings. While contact sensitivity to sulphite additives in topical medications is increasingly being recognized, skin reactions also occur after ingestion of or parenteral exposure to sulphites. Most studies report a 3-10% prevalence of sulphite sensitivity among asthmatic subjects following ingestion of these additives. However, the severity of these reactions varies, and steroid-dependent asthmatics, those with marked airway hyperresponsiveness, and children with chronic asthma, appear to be at greater risk. In addition to episodic and acute symptoms, sulphites may also contribute to chronic skin and respiratory symptoms. To date, the mechanisms underlying sulphite sensitivity remain unclear, although a number of potential mechanisms have been proposed. Physicians should be aware of the range of clinical manifestations of sulphite sensitivity, as well as the potential sources of exposure. Minor modifications to diet or behaviour lead to excellent clinical outcomes for sulphite-sensitive individuals.

Animal models have been used to elucidate asthma pathophysiology, and to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic targets. Several recent review articles (Epstein, 2004; Lloyd, 2007; Boyce and Austen, 2005; Zosky and Sly, 2007) have discussed the potential value of these models. Allergen challenge models reproduce many features of clinical asthma and have been widely used by investigators; however, the majority involve acute allergen challenge procedures. It is recognised that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from continued or intermittent allergen exposure, usually via inhalation, and there has been a recent focus on developing chronic allergen exposure models, predominantly in mice. Here, we review the acute and chronic exposure mouse models, and consider their potential role and impact in the field of asthma research.

Asthma cases attributable to atopy: Results from the third national health and nutrition examination survey	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						allergens; allergic sensitization; allergy skin test; asthma; atopy; epidemiology; NHANES III; skin prick test; survey	HOUSE-DUST MITE; COMMON ALLERGENS; CAT ALLERGEN; ASSOCIATION; SENSITIZATION; POPULATION; EXPOSURE; ADOLESCENTS; REACTIVITY; CHILDHOOD	Background: The percentage of asthma cases attributable to atopy is the subject of debate. Objectives: The objectives were to estimate the percentage of asthma cases in the US population attributable to atopy and to examine associations between allergen-specific skin tests and asthma. Methods: Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which subjects age 6 to 59 years were skin tested with 10 allergens. Atopy was defined as at least 1 positive allergen-specific test. Doctor-diagnosed current asthma was assessed by questionnaire. Results: In the United States, 56.3% of the asthma cases were attributable to atopy, and that percentage was greater among males than females, among persons in the highest education category than in lower education categories, and among persons living in highly populated metropolitan areas than in all other areas. Each allergen-specific test was strongly associated with asthma before adjustment (odds ratios varied from 2.1 to 4.5); however, after adjustment by all the allergens, only tests to cat, Alternaria, white oak, and perennial rye were independently associated with asthma. Perennial rye was inversely associated with asthma. Of the 10 allergens, a positive response to cat accounted for the highest percentage of asthma cases (29.3%). Conclusion: About half of the current asthma cases in the US population represented by the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were attributable to atopy. Some allergen-specific skin tests were not independently associated with asthma. Clinical implications: If atopy could be prevented or reversed, or its effect on asthma blocked, then a large percentage of asthma cases in the US population could be prevented.

Ginkgo biloba leave extract: Biological, medicinal, and toxicological effects	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART C-ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENESIS & ECOTOXICOLOGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Gingko biloba leave extract; biological and toxicological effects; ginkgolidc; quercetin	HERB-DRUG INTERACTIONS; INDUCED NEURONAL DEATH; GLOBAL BRAIN ISCHEMIA; EGB 761 PROTECTS; DNA-DAMAGE; INDUCED NEPHROTOXICITY; INDUCED TOXICITY; NITRIC-OXIDE; IN-VITRO; CYTOCHROME-P450 PHENOTYPES	Ginkgo biloba leave extract is among the most widely sold herbal dietary supplements in the United States. Its purported biological effects include: scavenging free radical; lowering oxidative stress; reducing neural damages, reducing platelets aggregation; anti-inflammation; anti-tumor activities; and anti-aging. Clinically, it has been prescribed to treat CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and cognitive deficits. It exerts allergy and changes in bleeding time. While its mutagenicity or carcinogenic activity has not been reported, its components, quercetin, kaempferol and rutin have been shown to be genotoxic. There are no standards or guidelines regulating the constituent components of Ginkgo biloba leave extract nor are exposure limits imposed. Safety evaluation of Ginkgo biloba leave extract is being conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Personal and ambient air pollution is associated with increased exhaled nitric oxide in children with asthma	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						asthma; epidemiology; exhaled nitric oxide; longitudinal data analysis; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; panel study; particulate air pollution	ANTIINFLAMMATORY MEDICATION USE; PARTICULATE-MATTER; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; EXPOSURE; SYMPTOMS; FLOW; PARTICLES; MONTELUKAST; POPULATION	BACKGROUND: Research has shown associations between pediatric asthma outcomes and airborne particulate matter (PM). The importance of particle components remains to be determined. METHODS: We followed a panel of 45 schoolchildren with persistent asthma living in Southern California. Subjects were monitored over 10 days with offline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a biomarker of airway inflammation. Personal active sampler exposures included continuous particulate matter < 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), 24-hr PM2.5 elemental and organic carbon (EC, OC), and 24-hr nitrogen dioxide. Ambient exposures included PM2.5, PM2.5 EC and OC, and NO2. Data were analyzed with mixed models controlling for personal temperature, humidity and 10-day period. RESULTS: The strongest positive associations were between FENO and 2-day average pollutant concentrations. Per interquartile range pollutant increase, these were: for 24 mu g/m(3) personal PM2.5, 1.1 ppb F-ENO [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-1.9]; for 0.6 mu g/m(3) personal EC, 0.7 ppb FENO (95% CI, 0.3-1.1); for 17 ppb personal NO2, 1.6 ppb FENO (95% CI, 0.4-2.8). Larger associations were found for ambient EC and smaller associations for ambient NO2. Ambient PM2.5 and personal and ambient OC were significant only in subjects taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone. Subjects taking both ICS and antileukotrienes showed no significant associations. Distributed lag models showed personal PM2.5 in the preceding 5 hr was associated with F-ENO. In two-pollutant models, the most robust associations were for personal and ambient EC and NO2, and for personal but not ambient PM2.5. CONCLUSION: PM associations with airway inflammation in asthmatics may be missed using ambient particle mass, which may not sufficiently represent causal pollutant components from fossil fuel combustion.

A systematic review and metaanalysis	CHEST			English	Review						antibiotics; childhood asthma; pediatrics	EARLY-CHILDHOOD; ALLERGIC DISEASE; BIRTH COHORT; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; 1ST YEAR; RISK; PREVALENCE; LIFE; RHINITIS; DATABASE	Objectives: To determine the association between antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and the development of childhood asthma. Design: Metaanalysis of observational studies retrieved through systematic search of all available electronic data sources. Studies included in the metaanalyses were those with populations exposed to one or more courses of antibiotics during the first year of life, and asthma diagnosis was defined as diagnosis by a physician between the age of 1 to 18 years. Setting: Retrospective and prospective studies published in the English-language literature from 1966 to present. Results: Eight studies (four prospective and four retrospective) examined the association between exposure to at least one course of antibiotics and development of childhood asthma. The total number of subjects for the analysis comparing exposure to at least one antibiotic to no exposure in the first year of life was 12,082 children and 1,817 asthma cases. In the dose-response analysis, we included data from a total of 27,167 children and 3,392 asthma cases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the eight studies was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 2.99). The association was significantly stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.07 to 3.85) than the prospective studies (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.42). Five of the eight studies examined whether the association was related to the number of courses of antibiotics taken in the first year of life. The overall OR for the dose-response analysis was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28) for each additional course of antibiotics; however, this association was not significantly stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.60) relative to the prospective studies (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20). Conclusions: Exposure to at least one course of antibiotics in the first year of life appears to be a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. Because of the limitations of the studies conducted to date, additional large-scale, prospective studies are needed to confirm this potential association.

From a literature search of PubMed, nine relevant studies were identified. All of them focused on the effects of short-term exposure such as asthma, respiratory symptoms, daily mortality, and lung function. Substantial quantitative information was only found for acute asthma in relation to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 mum. In comparison with the present general estimations for ambient particulate matter and adverse health effects, the relative risks were even stronger in the studies in which residential wood combustion was considered a major source of particulate matter. Thus there seems to be no reason to assume that the effects of particulate matter in areas polluted by wood smoke are weaker than elsewhere.

Our objective was to evaluate the relationships between dustborne and airborne fungi and to identify factors that modify these relationships. Methods: From November 1994 to September 1996 sequential duplicate 45-l air samples were collected in bedrooms of 496 homes in the Boston area, using a Burkard culture plate sampler. After air sampling, bedroom floors were sampled with a vacuum cleaner that was modified to collect dust in a cellulose extraction thimble. Dust was sieved, and the fine dust was dilution-plated onto DG-18 media. Results: Concentrations of total culturable fungi per gram of bedroom-floor dust were correlated weakly, but significantly, with those of indoor air (r = 0.13, P < 0.05). Concentrations of some individual taxa in the dust and indoor air were also weakly associated. Adjusting for the concentrations of fungi in outdoor air, dustborne fungal concentrations were positively associated with those in indoor air for the taxa Cladosporium and Penicillium , but not for total fungi. The indoor air fungal levels were often predicted by different covariates to those predicting fungal levels in dust. The type of housing (house or apartment) and the presence of carpeting were often predictive factors for dust fungi. In contrast, outdoor fungal levels were often predictive of the indoor air fungal levels. Conclusions: Because our data do not indicate a strong overall relationship between culturable fungi in dust and indoor air, the results from these two methods (dust and air sampling) likely represent different types of potential fungal exposures to residents. It may be essential to collect both air and dust samples, as well as information on housing characteristics, as indicators for fungal exposure.

Results from this laboratory have shown that the coarse inhalable particle fraction (PM2.5-10) is responsible for most of the PM effects on human airway macrophages (AM), including induction of cytokine production. Endotoxins associated with these particles account for a large part of their potency, as activity of PM can be inhibited by polymixin B and an activating moiety bound by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP). The hypothesis behind the present study was that not only particle-bound LPS, but also Gram-negative (Gram-) and Gram-positive (Gram+) bacteria are responsible for PM-induced stimulation of AM, and therefore that PM are likely to activate receptors involved in recognition of microbes. Low level contamination of model pollution particles with environmental Staphyloccocus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas species was found to confer cytokine-inducing activity on inactive particles. Only one Gram- bacterium was sufficient for significant stimulatation of 100 AM, whereas at least three times more Gram+ bacteria were required for a similar level of response. Cytokine responses induced by PM as well as Gram+ and Gram- bacteria were inhibited by anti-CD14 antibody and required the presence of LBP-containing serum. The involvement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 in recognition of PMZ.,o was investigated in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CD14 and TLR2 or TLR4. TLR4 was found to be involved in PM2.5-10 and Pseudomonas-induced activation, whereas TLR2 activation was induced by both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria and by PM. The synthetic lipid A analog E5531 fully inhibited the response to purified LPS and partially inhibited the response to PM and Pseudomonas. In contrast, E5531 had no effect on the response to Staphylococcus. Taken together, these results implicate microbial components as important players in AM-dependent inflammatory responses to PM.

In this case-control study, cases (N=417) consisted of white children aged 0-14 years who were admitted for asthma and who resided in Erie County, New York, excluding the city of Buffalo. Controls (N=461) were children in the same age range admitted during the same time period for nonrespiratory diseases. Subjects' residential addresses were linked to traffic information provided by the New York State Department of Transportation. After adjustments for age and poverty level were made, children hospitalized for asthma were more likely to live on roads with the highest tertile of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) (odds ratio (OR): 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.29) within 200 m and were more likely to have trucks and trailers passing by within 200m of their residence (OR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.03-1.99) compared to controls. However, childhood asthma hospitalization was not significantly associated with residential distance from state roads, annual VMT within 500m, or whether trucks or trailers passed by within 500m.

Respiratory health effects of air pollution: Update on biomass smoke and traffic pollution	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Biomass; traffic; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; asthma; air pollutants; particulate matter	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; DIESEL EXHAUST PARTICLES; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK-FACTORS; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; AMBIENT AIR; LOS-ANGELES; SOLID-FUEL; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES	Mounting evidence suggests that air pollution contributes to the large global burden of respiratory and allergic diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and possibly tuberculosis. Although associations between air pollution and respiratory disease are complex, recent epidemiologic studies have led to an increased recognition of the emerging importance of traffic-related air pollution in both developed and less-developed countries, as well as the continued importance of emissions from domestic fires burning biomass fuels, primarily in the less-developed world. Emissions from these sources lead to personal exposures to complex mixtures of air pollutants that change rapidly in space and time because of varying emission rates, distances from source, ventilation rates, and other factors. Although the high degree of variability in personal exposure to pollutants from these sources remains a challenge, newer methods for measuring and modeling these exposures are beginning to unravel complex associations with asthma and other respiratory tract diseases. These studies indicate that air pollution from these sources is a major preventable cause of increased incidence and exacerbation of respiratory disease. Physicians can help to reduce the risk of adverse respiratory effects of exposure to biomass and traffic air pollutants by promoting awareness and supporting individual and community-level interventions.

Counterregulation between the Fc epsilon RI Pathway and Antiviral Responses in Human Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							INTERFERON-PRODUCING CELLS; ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-9; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; ASTHMA; VIRUS; EXPRESSION; IMMUNITY; ALPHA; IGE	Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play essential roles in directing immune responses. These cells may be particularly important in determining the nature of immune responses to viral infections in patients with allergic asthma as well those with other atopic diseases. The purposes of this study were 1) to compare the functional capacity of pDCs in patients with one type of allergic disorder, allergic asthma, and controls; 2) to determine whether IgE cross-linking affects antiviral responses of influenza-exposed pDCs; and 3) to determine whether evidence of counterregulation of Fc epsilon RIa and IFN-alpha pathways exists in these cells. pDC function was assessed in a subset of asthma patients and in controls by measuring IFN-alpha production after exposure of purified pDCs to influenza viruses. Fc epsilon RIa expression on pDCs was determined by flow cytometry in blood samples from patients with allergic asthma and controls. pDCs from patients with asthma secreted significantly less IFN-alpha upon exposure to influenza A (572 versus 2815; p = 0.03), and secretion was inversely correlated with serum IgE levels. Moreover, IgE cross-linking prior to viral challenge resulted in 1) abrogation of the influenza-induced pDC IFN-alpha response; 2) diminished influenza and gardiquimod-induced TLR-7 upregulation in pDCs; and 3) interruption of influenza-induced upregulation of pDC maturation/ costimulatory molecules. In addition, exposure to influenza and gardiquimod resulted in upregulation of TLR-7, with concomitant downregulation of Fc epsilon RIa expression in pDCs. These data suggest that counterregulation of Fc epsilon RI and TLR-7 pathways exists in pDCs, and that IgE cross-linking impairs pDC antiviral responses.

Beneficial intestinal microbes originate from the maternal vaginal tract and thus are more likely to be transferred during vaginal births than during Caesarean sections (C-sections). Objective To determine whether children born by C-section have a different risk of allergic disorders compared with those delivered vaginally. We also tested the hypothesis that the risk of allergic disorders is highest for children born after 'repeat C-sections'. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 8953 children aged 3-10 years. Children diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR), asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), or food allergies were identified from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region electronic records. The children's sex, birth weight, birth order, postnatal exposure to antibiotics as well as the mothers' age, ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status during pregnancy, and use of asthma or hayfever medications were identified through the mothers' medical records or through the Oregon Birth Registry. Results The risk of being diagnosed with AR was significantly higher in the children born by C-section than in those delivered vaginally: adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.37%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.63. Delivery by C-section was also associated with the subsequent diagnosis of asthma (OR=1.24%, 95% CI=1.01-1.53); this association was gender specific, with a positive association restricted to girls (OR for asthma in girls: OR=1.53%, 95% CI=1.11-2.10; in boys: OR=1.08%, 95% CI=0.81-1.43). There was no significant association between mode of delivery and AD. If children born in a 'repeat C-section' were considered separately the risk of being diagnosed with AR increased further (OR=1.78%, 95% CI=1.34-2.37). The same increase was noted for asthma in girls (OR=1.83%, 95% CI=1.13-2.97) but not in boys. Conclusion Caesarean sections may be associated with an increased risk of developing AR in childhood.

Symptoms typically begin in the first month of life in association with failure to thrive and may progress to acidemia and shock. Symptoms resolve after the causal protein is removed from the diet but recur with a characteristic symptom pattern on re-exposure. Approximately 2 hours after reintroduction of the protein, vomiting ensues, followed by an elevation of the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, diarrhea, and possibly lethargy and hypotension. The disorder is generally not associated with detectable food-specific IgE antibody. There are increasing reports of additional causal foods, prolonged clinical courses, and onset outside of early infancy, leading to description of a food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome. The disorder poses numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The purpose of this report is to delineate the characteristic clinical features and review the possible pathophysiologic basis to frame a rational strategy toward management.

We performed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of one year of use of impermeable bedding covers in the bedrooms of patients with rhinitis who were sensitized to house-dust mites to determine the effects on the signs and symptoms of disease. Methods: Three participating university medical centers enrolled 279 patients with allergic rhinitis who were randomly assigned to receive impermeable or non-impermeable (control) covers for their mattress, pillow, and duvet or blanket. At the start of the study, all participants received information on general allergen-avoidance measures. The severity of rhinitis was measured on a rhinitis-specific visual-analogue scale and by means of a daily symptom score and nasal allergen provocation testing. We also measured the concentrations of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1) and D. farinae (Der f 1) in dust from patients' mattresses, bedroom floors, and living-room floors at base line and after 12 months as a measure of the efficacy of the intervention. Results: A total of 232 patients completed the study. There was a significant reduction in Der p1 and Der f 1 concentrations in the mattresses of the impermeable-cover group, whereas there was no significant reduction in the control group. However, there was no significant effect on the clinical outcome measures. Analyses of subgroups defined according to age, level of exposure, type and severity of sensitization, or characteristics of the patient's home had similar results. Conclusions: Mite-proof bedding covers, as part of a structured allergy-control program, reduced the level of exposure to mite allergens. Despite the success of the intervention, this single avoidance measure did not lead to a significant improvement of clinical symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis.

Complex mixtures (fine particulate matter and tobacco smoke) have been associated with respiratory symptoms and hospital admissions for asthma. The toxic ingredients of these mixtures are HAPs, but whether ambient HAP exposures. can induce asthma remains unclear. Certain HAPs are occupational asthmagens, whereas others may act as adjuncts during sensitization. HAPs may exacerbate asthma because, once sensitized, individuals can respond to remarkably low concentrations, and irritants lower the bronchoconstrictive threshold to respiratory antigens. Adverse responses after ambient exposures to complex mixtures often occur at concentrations below those producing effects in controlled human exposures to a single compound. In addition, certain HAPs that have been associated with asthma in occupational settings may interact with criteria pollutants in ambient air to exacerbate asthma. Based on these observations and past experience with 188 HAPs, a list of 19 compounds that could have the highest impact on the induction or exacerbation of asthma was developed. Nine additional compounds were identified that might exacerbate asthma based on their irritancy, respirability, or ability to react with biological macromolecules. Although the ambient levels of these 28 compounds are largely unknown, estimated exposures from emissions inventories and limited air monitoring suggest that aldehydes (especially acrolein and formaldehyde) and metals (especially nickel and chromium compounds) may have possible health risk indices sufficient for additional attention. Recommendations for research are presented regarding exposure monitoring and evaluation of biologic mechanisms controlling how these substances induce and exacerbate asthma. Key words: acrolein, aldehydes, asthma, cadmium, chromium, formaldehyde, hazardous air pollutants, metals, nickel, ozone, particulate matter, urban air toxics.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLIT in grass pollen-induced seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis. Methods A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 56 adults over 18 months. Outcome measures included diary scores of seasonal symptoms and medication use, overall assessments, conjunctival and intradermal provocation tests and serum antibody measurements. To investigate possible mechanisms, sublingual biopsies were taken for measurement of local T cells, antigen-presenting cells and IL-12 mRNA expression. Results There were no significant differences between the mimunotherapy (IT) and placebo groups for diary symptom scores (P = 0.48) or rescue medication (P = 0.19). The patients' overall assessment of hayfever severity compared with previous years showed a highly significant improvement in favour of the IT group (P < 0.02). After treatment the late skin response was smaller (P = 0.003) and the ratio of serum allergen-specific IgG4/IgE was higher (P = 0.05) in the IT group. Both of these variables correlated with the clinical response to SLIT. There were no differences between groups in either the sublingual epithelium or lamina propria for numbers of CD3(+) cells (epithelium: P = 0.9. lamina propria: P = 0.2), CD1a(+) cells (P = 0.3, P = 0.25), CD68(+) cells (P = 0.9 P = 1.0) or IL-12 mRNA(+) cells (P = 0.6, P = 0.4). Local side-effects were minor and there were no serious treatment-related adverse events. Conclusion Grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy was well tolerated. Although there was no significant change in diary scores, the improvement in overall assessments, which correlated with inhibition of the late skin response and increases in serum IgG4: IgE ratio, indicates the need for larger, dose-ranging studies.

We investigated whether the steroid-induced improvement in the provocative concentration of AMP producing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PC20 AMP) is more closely associated with the concomitant reduction in airway inflammation than is the improvement in PC20 methacholine. In 120 asthmatic patients, we measured PC20 methacholine and PC20 AMP as well as sputum induction and nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air before and after 2 weeks of treatment with corticosteroids. Improvement in PC20 AMP was solely related to reduction in airway inflammation (i.e., change in the number of sputum eosinophils, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and concentration of NO in exhaled air). In contrast, improvement in PC20 methacholine was related to both reduction in airway inflammation (i.e., change in the number of sputum eosinophils and lymphocytes) and increase in FEV1 %predicted. The total explained variance of the improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness was greater for AMP than for methacholine (36% versus 22%, respectively). We conclude that PC20 AMP is more sensitive to changes in acute airway inflammation than is PC20 methacholine, further reinforcing the notion that PC20 AMP can be a useful tool for monitoring the effects of antilnflammatory therapy.

The aim of this European study was to determine which airway symptoms predominate in different types of animal farmers (cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep) and to compare the prevalence of symptoms to the general population. A total of 6,156 randomly selected animal farmers in Denmark, Germany (Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen), Switzerland, and Spain completed a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and farming characteristics in 1995-1997. The prevalence of general respiratory symptoms was compared to the results of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) obtained in the same regions. Pig farmers were at highest risk for the development of work-related symptoms. A significant dose-response relationship between daily hours worked inside animal houses and symptoms was established for pig and poultry farmers. Additionally, self-reported nasal allergies (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 3.92 (3.26-4.71)) and nasal irritation during work (3.98 (3.35-4.73)) were shown to be associated with the development of chronic phlegm. The prevalence of wheezing, shortness of breath, asthma and nasal allergies was significantly lower among all farmers in the age group 20-44 yrs than among the general population. However, the prevalence of usually bringing up phlegm in winter among farmers was significantly higher than in the general population (9.4 (8.3-10.5%) versus 7.5 (6.5-8.5%)). Individual factors have been shown to be related to the prevalence of chronic phlegm among farmers. Additionally, this study could support the hypothesis that farming could be negatively related to allergic diseases.

Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. We measured exhaled ethane in 26 asthmatic subjects (mean age +/- SEM, 38 +/- 8 yr; 15 male, FEV1 60 +/- 4%) and compared it with exhaled nitric oxide (NO) measured by chemiluminescence, a noninvasive marker of oxidative stress and inflammation. Exhaled ethane was collected during a flow- and pressure-controlled exhalation into a reservoir discarding dead space air contaminated with ambient air. A sample of the expired air was analyzed by chromatography. Exhaled ethane levels were elevated in asthma patients not receiving steroid (n = 12, 2.06 +/- 0.30 ppb) compared with steroid-treated patients (n = 14, 0.79 +/- 0.70 ppb, p < 0.01) and to 14 nonsmoking control subjects (0.88 +/- 0.09 ppb, p < 0.05). In patients not receiving steroid treatment there was a positive correlation between exhaled ethane and NO (r = 0.55, p < 0.05) and air trapping assessed by the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) (r = 0.60, p < 0.05). In addition, untreated patients with FEV1 < 60% predicted value had higher concentrations of ethane (2.86 +/- 0.37 ppb) compared with less obstructed patients (FEV1 > 60%, 1.26 +/- 0.12 ppb, p < 0.05). NO concentrations were higher in patients not on steroid treatment (14.7 +/- 1.7 ppb) than in steroid-treated patients (8.6 +/- 0.5 ppb, p < 0.05). Exhaled ethane is elevated in asthma, reduced in steroid-treated patients, and correlates with NO and airway obstruction. It may be a useful noninvasive marker of oxidative stress.

Symptoms can range from mild erythema or rhinitis, to acute, and possibly fatal, anaphylactic shock. Because such allergic responses require complex interactions between the protein and the immune system, they are notoriously difficult to predict. Nevertheless, it is clear that some proteins are intrinsically more allergenic than others. The challenge for toxicologists is to identify those characteristics that confer on proteins the potential to induce allergic sensitization and allergic disease. Here, we first consider the potential contribution that individual epitopes may make to the allergenicity of a protein. These are the minimal peptide units within proteins that can be recognized by the immune system and are a fundamental requirement for all immune responses, including those resulting in allergic sensitization. It appears that allergens must necessarily contain B-cell epitopes to which immunoglobulin E (IgE) can bind, and T-cell epitopes capable of inducing a type 2 T-lymphocyte response. Nevertheless, it appears doubtful that the presence of appropriate epitopes alone is sufficient to endow a protein with allergenic potential. We therefore consider also the contribution that other features and characteristics of proteins may make to their overall allergenicity. In particular, we consider the effects that resistance to proteolysis, post-translational glycosylation, and enzymatic activity may have. It appears that relative stability in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) sometimes correlates with allergenic activity. However, this is not universally true, and it is known that there are protein allergens, such as some of those associated with oral allergy syndrome, that are unstable. Nevertheless, if stability in SGF is associated with the intrinsic allergenicity of many proteins irrespective of the route of exposure, then this may reflect some more fundamental property of proteins, and possibly their stability in other biologic matrices and/or to intracellular proteases. Post-translational modification appears generally to enhance allergenicity, perhaps by increasing uptake and detection of the protein by the immune system. Some enzymatic activities also enhance allergenicity through what appear to be several different mechanisms, including nonspecific activation of cells participating in the immunologic response. Overall, it appears likely that many factors can contribute to the overall allergenicity of any given protein. Some, such as the presence of epitopes with allergenic potential, may be essential. Others, such as the glycosylation status, resistance to proteolysis, and enzymatic activity, may play a subsidiary but nevertheless critically important role. By better defining the limits within which these factors operate, we can hope to gain a better understanding of the fundamental origins of protein allergenicity, and therefore be in a position to identify and characterize the hazards and risks of allergic disease associated with novel proteins.

Endocrine Disruptors and Asthma-Associated Chemicals in Consumer Products	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Review						alkylphenols; asthma; bisphenol A; consumer products; cyclosiloxane; endocrine disruptors; fragrance compounds; parabens; phthalates; UV filters	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; PRENATAL PHTHALATE EXPOSURE; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RAT; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; COSMETIC PRODUCTS; POLYCYCLIC MUSKS; BISPHENOL-A; UV FILTERS; INDOOR AIR	BACKGROUND: Laboratory and human studies raise concerns about endocrine disruption and asthma resulting from exposure to chemicals in consumer products. Limited labeling or testing information is available to evaluate products as exposure sources. OBJECTIVES: We analytically quantified endocrine disruptors and asthma-related chemicals in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, cleaners, sunscreens, and vinyl products. We also evaluated whether product labels provide information that can be used to select products without these chemicals. METHODS: We selected 213 commercial products representing 50 product types. We tested 42 composited samples of high-market-share products, and we tested 43 alternative products identified using criteria expected to minimize target compounds. Analytes included parabens, phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, ethanolamines, alkylphenols, fragrances, glycol ethers, cyclosiloxanes, and ultraviolet (UV) filters. RESULTS: We detected 55 compounds, indicating a wide range of exposures from common products. Vinyl products contained > 10% bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and could be an important source of DEHP in homes. In other products, the highest concentrations and numbers of detects were in the fragranced products (e.g., perfume, air fresheners, and dryer sheets) and in sunscreens. Some products that did not contain the well-known endocrine-disrupting phthalates contained other less-studied phthalates (dicyclohexyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, and di-n-propyl phthalate; also endocrine-disrupting compounds), suggesting a substitution. Many detected chemicals were not listed on product labels. CONCLUSIONS: Common products contain complex mixtures of EDCs and asthma-related compounds. Toxicological studies of these mixtures are needed to understand their biological activity. Regarding epidemiology, our findings raise concern about potential confounding from co-occurring chemicals and misclassification due to variability in product composition. Consumers should be able to avoid some target chemicals-synthetic fragrances, BPA, and regulated active ingredients-using purchasing criteria. More complete product labeling would enable consumers to avoid the rest of the target chemicals.

Innate lymphoid cells responding to IL-33 mediate airway hyperreactivity independently of adaptive immunity	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Innate; natural killer T; natural helper cells; T(H)2; IL-33; IL-13; glycolipid; asthma	KILLER T-CELLS; INVARIANT NKT CELLS; IN-VIVO; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; EXPERIMENTAL ASTHMA; TYPE-2 IMMUNITY; INFLAMMATION; RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES	Background: Asthma has been considered an immunologic disease mediated by T(H)2 cells and adaptive immunity. However, clinical and experimental observations suggest that additional pathways might regulate asthma, particularly in its nonallergic forms, such as asthma associated with air pollution, stress, obesity, and infection. Objectives: Our goal was to understand T(H)2 cell-independent conditions that might lead to airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. Methods: We examined a murine model of experimental asthma in which AHR was induced with glycolipid antigens, which activate natural killer T (NKT) cells. Results: In this model AHR developed rapidly when mice were treated with NKT cell-activating glycolipid antigens, even in the absence of conventional CD4(+) T cells. The activated NKT cells directly induced alveolar macrophages to produce IL-33, which in turn activated NKT cells, as well as natural helper cells, a newly described non-T, non-B, innate lymphoid cell type, to increase production of IL-13. Surprisingly, this glycolipid-induced AHR pathway required not only IL-13 but also IL-33 and its receptor, ST2, because it was blocked by an anti-ST2 mAb and was greatly reduced in ST2(-/-) mice. When adoptively transferred into IL-13(-/-) mice, both wild-type natural helper cells and NKT cells were sufficient for the development of glycolipid-induced AHR. Conclusion: Because plant pollens, house dust, and some bacteria contain glycolipids that can directly activate NKT cells, these studies suggest that AHR and asthma can fully develop or be greatly enhanced through innate immune mechanisms involving IL-33, natural helper cells, and NKT cells.

Short-term Associations between Ambient Air Pollutants and Pediatric Asthma Emergency Department Visits	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						ambient particulate matter, asthma; minors; ozone	SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; CASE-CROSSOVER ANALYSES; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; TIME-SERIES METHODS; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; REFERENT SELECTION; AEROSOL RESEARCH; ORGANIC-CARBON; DAILY DEATHS	Rationale: Certain outdoor air pollutants cause asthma exacerbations in children. To advance understanding of these relationships, further characterization of the dose-response and pollutant lag effects are needed, as are investigations of pollutant species beyond the commonly measured criteria pollutants. Objectives: Investigate short-term associations between ambient air pollutant concentrations and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. Methods: Daily counts of emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze among children aged 5 to 17 years were collected from 41 Metropolitan Atlanta hospitals during 1993-2004 (n = 91,386 visits). Ambient concentrations of gaseous pollutants and speciated particulate matter were available from stationary monitors during this time period Rate ratios for the warm season (May to October) and cold season (November to April) were estimated using Poisson generalized linear models in the framework of a case-crossover analysis Measurements and Main Results: Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models. These associations tended to be of the highest magnitude for concentrations on the day of the emergency department visit and were present at relatively low ambient concentrations. Conclusions. Even at relatively low ambient concentrations, ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources independently contributed to the burden of emergency department visits for pediatric asthma	[Strickland, Matthew J.; Darrow, Lyndsey A.; Klein, Mitchel; Sarnat, Jeremy A.; Sarnat, Stefanie E.; Tolbert, Paige E.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Flanders, W.

Toll-like receptor and IL-12 signaling control susceptibility to contact hypersensitivity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; CD8(+) T-CELLS; DENDRITIC CELLS; IFN-ALPHA; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CUTTING EDGE; FLUORESCEIN ISOTHIOCYANATE; SENSITIZER TRINITROPHENYL; MEDIATED INHIBITION; C57BL/10SCCR MICE	Allergic contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Interleukin (IL)-12 is considered to be important in the generation of the allergen-specific T cell response. Loss of IL-12 function in IL-12R beta 2-deficient mice, however, did not ameliorate the allergic immune response, suggesting alternate IL-12-independent pathways in the induction of CHS. Because exposure to contact allergens always takes place in the presence of microbial skin flora, we investigated the potential role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the induction of CHS. Using mice deficient in TLR4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-12 receptor (R) beta 2, or both, we show that the concomitant absence of TLR4 and IL-12R beta 2, but not the absence of TLR4 or IL-12R beta 2 alone, prevented DC-mediated sensitization, generation of effector T cells, and the subsequent CHS response to 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB), oxazolone, and fluorescein isothiocyanate. Introduction of the TLR4 transgene into the TLR4/IL-12R beta 2 mutant restored the CHS inducibility, showing a requirement for TLR4 in IL-12-independent CHS induction. Furthermore, the concomitant absence of TLR2 and TLR4 prevented the induction of CHS to TNCB in IL-12-competent mice. Finally, CHS was inducible in germ-free wild-type and IL-12R beta 2-deficient mice, but not in germ-free TLR4/IL-12R beta 2 double deficient mice, suggesting that the necessary TLR activation may proceed via endogenous ligands.

Grass pollen immunotherapy induces an allergen-specific IgA2 antibody response associated with mucosal TGF-beta expression	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; T-CELL DIFFERENTIATION; VENOM IMMUNOTHERAPY; DENDRITIC CELLS; B-CELLS; IGG ANTIBODIES; SECRETORY IGA; HOUSE-DUST; INTERLEUKIN-10	Allergen immunotherapy (IT) has long-term efficacy in IgE-mediated allergic rhinitis and asthma. IT has been shown to modify lymphocyte responses to allergen, inducing IL-10 production and IgG Abs. In contrast, a putative role for IgA and local TGF-beta-producing cells remains to be determined. In 44 patients with seasonal rhinitis/asthma, serum IgA1, IgA2, and polymeric (J chain-containing) Abs to the major allergen Phi p 5 were determined by ELISA before and after a 2-year double-blind trial of grass pollen (Phleum pratense) injection IT. Nasal TGF-beta expression was assessed by in situ hybridization. Sera from five IT patients were fractionated for functional analysis of the effects of IgA and IgG Abs on IL-10 production by blood monocytes and allergen-IgE binding to B cells. Serum Phi p 5-specific IgA2 Abs increased after a 2-year treatment (similar to 8-fold increase, p = 0.002) in contrast to IgA1. Increases in polymeric Abs to Phi p 5 (similar to 2-fold increase,p = 0.02) and in nasal TGF-beta mRNA (p = 0.05) were also observed, and TGF-beta mRNA correlated with serum Phi p 5 IgA2 (r = 0.61,p = 0.009). Post-IT IgA fractions triggered IL-10 secretion by monocytes while not inhibiting allergen-IgE binding to B cells as observed with IgG fractions. This study shows for the first time that the IgA response to IT is selective for IgA2, correlates with increased local TGF-beta expression, and induces monocyte IL-10 expression, suggesting that IgA Abs could thereby contribute to the tolerance developed in IT-treated allergic patients.

The objective of this retrospective, cohort study was to assess fracture risk in patients exposed to oral GCs. Patients from an administrative claims database who were prescribed oral GCs and were enrolled 1 year before and 1 year after the initial oral GC claim were matched with a comparison population on age, sex, and date of first claim. Measurements of exposure included amount, duration, and pattern of oral GC use. The osteoporosis-related risk of fracture was based on the ratio of hazard functions estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates (and 95% CI) for fractures were hip 1.87 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.9), vertebral 2.92 (95% CI, 2.0 to 4.3), wrist/forearm 1.03 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.4), nonvertebral 1.68 (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.9), any fracture 1.75 (95% CI, 1.6 to 1.9). A dose dependence of fracture risk was observed for hip, vertebral, nonvertebral, and any fractures. Long duration and continuous pattern of GC use demonstrated a significant 5-fold increased risk of hip and 5.9-fold increased risk of vertebral fracture. The combined effect of higher dose, longer duration, and continuous pattern further increased RR estimates to 7-fold for hip and 17-fold for vertebral fractures. This study confirms previous observations that suggest oral GCs have a rapid deleterious effect on trabecular-rich bone. The emerging relationship between amount, duration, and pattern of oral GC exposure and fracture risk should be considered in clinical practice and managed care settings to avoid the debilitating effects of fractures in patients.

In atopic dermatitis, circulating cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-bearing (CLA(+)) CD45RO(+) T cells with skin-specific homing property represent an activated memory/effector T cell subset. They express high levels of Fas and Fas ligand and undergo activation-induced apoptosis. The freshly purified (CLA(+)) CD45RO(+) T cells of atopic individuals display distinct features of in vivo-triggered apoptosis such as procaspase degradation and active caspase-8 formation. In particular, the Th1 compartment of activated memory/effector T cells selectively undergoes activation-induced cell death, skewing the immune response toward surviving Th2 cells in atopic dermatitis patients. The apoptosis of circulating memory/effector T cells was confined to atopic individuals whereas non-atopic patients such as psoriasis, intrinsic-type asthma, contact dermatitis, intrinsic type of atopic dermatitis, bee venom allergic patients, and healthy controls showed no evidence for enhanced T cell apoptosis in vivo. These results define a novel mechanism for peripheral Th2 response in atopic diseases.

Methods: In the population based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) women were asked twice during pregnancy (at 18-20 weeks and 32 weeks) about their usage of paracetamol and aspirin. Six months after birth, and at yearly intervals thereafter, mothers were asked about wheezing and eczema symptoms in their child. The effects of paracetamol and aspirin use in pregnancy on the risk in the offspring of wheezing at 30-42 months (n=9400) and eczema at 18-30 months (n=10 2 16) and on their risk of different wheezing patterns (defined by presence or absence of wheezing at <6 months and at 30-42 months) were examined. Results: Paracetamol was taken frequently (most days/daily) by only 1% of women. After controlling for potential confounders, frequent paracetamol use in late pregnancy (20-32 weeks), but not in early pregnancy (<18-20 weeks), was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in the offspring at 30-42 months (adjusted odds ratio (OR) compared with no use 2.10 (95% Cl 1.30 to 3.41); p=0.003), particularly if wheezing started before 6 months (OR 2.34 (95% Cl 1.24 to 4.40); P=0.008). Assuming a causal relation, only about 1% of wheezing at 30-42 months was attributable to this exposure. Frequent paracetomol use in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of eczema. Frequent aspirin use in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of wheezing only at <6 months. Conclusions: Frequent use of paracetamol in late pregnancy may increase the risk of wheezing in the offspring, although such an effect could explain only about 1% of the population prevalence of wheezing in early childhood.

These Ca2+ oscillations spread as Ca2+ waves through the SMCs at similar to48 mum/s. The magnitude of the airway contraction, the initial Ca2+ transient, and the frequency of the subsequent Ca2+ oscillations were all concentration-dependent. In a Ca2+-free solution, ACH induced a similar Ca2+ response, except that the Ca2+ oscillations ceased after 1-1.5 min. Incubation with thapsigargin, xestospongin, or ryanodine inhibited the ACH-induced Ca2+ signaling. A comparison of airway contraction with the ACH-induced Ca2+ response of the SMCs revealed that the onset of airway contraction correlated with the initial Ca2+ transient, and that sustained airway contraction correlated with the occurrence of the Ca2+ oscillations. Buffering intracellular Ca2+ with BATIA prohibited Ca2+ signaling and airway contraction, indicating a Ca2+-dependent pathway. Cessation of the Ca2+ oscillations, induced by ACH-esterase, halothane, or the absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a relaxation of the airways The concentration dependence of the airway contraction matched the concentration dependeuce of the increased frequency of the Ca2+ oscillations. These results indicate that Ca2+ oscillations, induced by ACH in murine bronchial SMCs, are generated by Ca2+ release from the SR involving IPs and ryanodine receptors, and are required to maintain airway contraction.

In common with other forms of allergy the disease progresses in two stages; an initial phase during which sensitization is acquired, followed later (after subsequent exposure to the same chemical allergen) by elicitation of a cutaneous inflammatory reaction. The development of skin sensitization is associated with, and requires, the activation and clonal expansion of allergen responsive T lymphocytes and it is these cells that orchestrate the cutaneous allergic reaction. In recent years, much has been: learned of the characteristics of immune responses to skin sensitizing chemicals and of the roles played by dendritic cells, cytokines and chemokines. Some of the more interesting cellular and molecular mechanisms are reviewed briefly in this article. A more detailed appreciation of responses induced by chemical allergens has in turn facilitated the design of novel approaches to the toxicological evaluation of skin sensitization. Real progress has been made, not only in the development of improved methods for hazard identification and characterization, but also in the application of new paradigms for risk assessment. The newer methods now available and the opportunities that exist for further advances are considered. Finally, progress has been made in the characterization of skin sensitization in humans and in the clinical management of ACD. This article seeks to consider skin sensitization and ACD in holistic fashion, bridging experimental observations with clinical disease and basic mechanisms with practical toxicology.

DEPs can synergize with allergen at the human upper respiratory mucosa to enhance allergen-specific IgE production, initiate a T(H)2 cytokine environment, and even promote primary allergic sensitization. Experiments suggest that these effects result from the initial activation of mast cells to produce IL-4. Objective: We sought to demonstrate that in vivo mast cell activation by DEPs plus allergen will also affect the release of classic mast cell mediators and consequently enhance the immediate-phase response. Methods: Dust mite-sensitive subjects were challenged intranasally with allergen, and symptom scores and histamine levels in nasal wash samples were compared after prechallenge with 0.3 mg of DEPs, Results: If the subjects were first sprayed with DEPs, mean symptom scores rose from 3.7 to 9.9; additionally, only one fifth of the amount of intranasal dust mite allergen was required to induce clinical symptoms. DEPs alone had no effect. The changes in symptoms correlated with histamine levels measured in nasal lavage specimens from these subjects, Although challenge with DEPs alone did not induce histamine release, challenge with both DEPs and allergen resulted in 3-fold higher histamine concentrations than those seen with allergen alone. In contrast, carbon black particles (elemental carbon devoid of chemicals) had no effect. The role of chemicals was confirmed because degranulation of a murine mast cell fine by Fc epsilon RI cross-linking was increased significantly (by 72%) by the soluble organic chemicals extracted from DEPs. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that exposure to DEPs can enhance the severity of clinical symptoms to allergen by enhancing mast cell degranulation.

Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence of mouse allergen in inner-city homes. Methods: A subset of 608 homes from the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study population had dust samples adequate for analysis of mouse allergen. In addition, data regarding the demographics and housing of the subjects were related to the mouse allergen levels. Results: Ninety-five percent of all homes had detectable mouse allergen (Mus m 1) in at least one room, with the highest levels found in kitchens (kitchen: range, 0-618 mug/g; median, 1.60 mug/g; bedroom: range, 0-294 mug/g; median, 0.52 mug/g; television-living room: range, 0-203 mug/g; median, 0.57 mug/g). By city, 100% of the kitchens in Baltimore had detectable mouse allergen, with the lowest percentage (74%) in Cleveland Mouse allergen levels correlated among rooms (R = 0.65-0.75). Forty-nine percent of the homes had reported problems with mice within the last year, and 29% of the homes had evidence of mice in one or more rooms on home inspection and had higher levels of mouse allergen (P = .0001). Higher allergen levels were also associated with evidence of cockroach infestation in any room (P = .006), None of the other subject or housing demographics evaluated were associated with a higher prevalence or level of mouse allergen.

Mice were exposed to either single or five ovalbumin challenges over 5 days. In both protocols, time-dependent increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular fibronectin, neutrophils and eosinophils were observed. The kinetics of these events were similar in both protocols; however, the magnitude of the response was much greater following repeated challenges. BAL protein levels and lymphocyte numbers were increased only following repeated challenges, whereas interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-4 were increased in both protocols. Histological analysis revealed a time-dependent increase in epithelial cell proliferation and in mucus-producing epithelial cells. Proliferation of alveolar cells was observed only following repeated challenges. Airway hyperreactivity was observed in both protocols but was much greater following repeated challenges. Pretreatment with dexamethasone fully inhibited the inflammatory response and airway hyperreactivity but only partially inhibited the remodeling process. These data suggest that glucocorticoids, although potent anti-inflammatory agents, may not be potent in reducing the lung remodeling process associated with asthma.

The method was applied in the French epidemiological study of the genetics and environment in asthma (EGEA). Methods-The JEM contains 22 exposure groups including 18 high risk groups based on known risk factors for occupational asthma, divided into high molecular weight agents, low molecular weight agents, and mixed environments. After applying the JEM to job codes, exposure estimates for each subject were reevaluated by examining job title texts. Three high risk exposure estimates for asthma were compared: firstly, applying the JEM to original codes (from different coders in each study centre); secondly, applying the JEM to revised codes (from one experienced coder); and thirdly, after reviewing JEM exposure estimates in the light of job title texts. Results-The study comprised 173 cases with asthma and 285 controls (age 18-65). Odds ratios (ORs) for asthma for high risk jobs were 1.0 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.6 to 1.7), applying the JEM to original codes; 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.3), applying the JEM to revised codes; and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.7), applying the JEM and subsequently re-evaluating exposure estimates from job title texts. Asthma ORs were 1.4 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.9) for high molecular weight agents, 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.4) for low molecular weight agents, and 2.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 5.2) for mixed environments. Conclusions-This asthma JEM, when enhanced by expert re-evaluation of exposure estimates from job title texts, may be a useful tool in general population studies of asthma. In this study, a 1.7-fold increase in prevalence odds of high risk exposures was found among asthmatic workers compared with controls, with risk magnitude varying for different classes of exposure.

The idea that outdoor air pollution can cause exacerbations of pre-existing asthma is supported by an evidence base that has been accumulating for several decades, with several studies suggesting a contribution to new-onset asthma as well. In this Series paper, we discuss the effects of particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), and mixed traffic-related air pollution. We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to inflammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation. Although several pollutants have been linked to new-onset asthma, the strength of the evidence is variable. We also discuss clinical implications, policy issues, and research gaps relevant to air pollution and asthma.

Sublingual Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis and Asthma A Systematic Review	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Review							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; GRASS-POLLEN EXTRACT; HOUSE-DUST-MITE; PARIETARIA-JUDAICA EXTRACT; JAPANESE CEDAR POLLINOSIS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SWALLOW IMMUNOTHERAPY; RESPIRATORY ALLERGY	Importance Allergic rhinitis affects up to 40% of the US population. To desensitize allergic individuals, subcutaneous injection immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy may be administered. In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, some US physicians use aqueous allergens, off-label, for sublingual desensitization. Objective To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of aqueous sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. Evidence Acquisition The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through December 22, 2012. English-language randomized controlled trials were included if they compared sublingual immunotherapy with placebo, pharmacotherapy, or other sublingual immunotherapy regimens and reported clinical outcomes. Studies of sublingual immunotherapy that are unavailable in the United States and for which a related immunotherapy is unavailable in the United States were excluded. Paired reviewers selected articles and extracted the data. The strength of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was graded based on the risk of bias (scored on allocation, concealment of intervention, incomplete data, sponsor company involvement, and other bias), consistency, magnitude of effect, and the directness of the evidence. Results Sixty-three studies with 5131 participants met the inclusion criteria. Participants' ages ranged from 4 to 74 years. Twenty studies (n=1814 patients) enrolled only children. The risk of bias was medium in 43 studies (68%). Strong evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy improves asthma symptoms, with 8 of 13 studies reporting greater than40% improvement vs the comparator. Moderate evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy use decreases rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, with 9 of 36 studies demonstrating greater than 40% improvement vs the comparator. Medication use for asthma and allergies decreased by more than 40% in 16 of 41 studies of sublingual immunotherapy with moderate grade evidence. Moderate evidence supports that sublingual immunotherapy improves conjunctivitis symptoms (13 studies), combined symptom and medication scores (20 studies), and disease-specific quality of life (8 studies). Local reactions were frequent, but anaphylaxis was not reported. Conclusions and Relevance The overall evidence provides a moderate grade level of evidence to support the effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma, but high-quality studies are still needed to answer questions regarding optimal dosing strategies. There were limitations in the standardization of adverse events reporting, but no life-threatening adverse events were noted in this review.

Response to self antigen imprints regulatory memory in tissues	NATURE			English	Article							T-CELLS; IN-VIVO; EXPRESSION; AUTOANTIGEN; HOMEOSTASIS; AUTOIMMUNE; DEPLETION; DISEASES; MICE	Immune homeostasis in tissues is achieved through a delicate balance between pathogenic T-cell responses directed at tissue-specific antigens and the ability of the tissue to inhibit these responses. The mechanisms by which tissues and the immune system communicate to establish and maintain immune homeostasis are currently unknown. Clinical evidence suggests that chronic or repeated exposure to self antigen within tissues leads to an attenuation of pathological autoimmune responses, possibly as a means to mitigate inflammatory damage and preserve function. Many human organ-specific autoimmune diseases are characterized by the initial presentation of the disease being the most severe, with subsequent flares being of lesser severity and duration(1). In fact, these diseases often spontaneously resolve, despite persistent tissue autoantigen expression(2). In the practice of antigen-specific immunotherapy, allergens or self antigens are repeatedly injected in the skin, with a diminution of the inflammatory response occurring after each successive exposure(3). Although these findings indicate that tissues acquire the ability to attenuate autoimmune reactions upon repeated responses to antigens, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we show that upon expression of self antigen in a peripheral tissue, thymus-derived regulatory T cells (T-reg cells) become activated, proliferate and differentiate into more potent suppressors, which mediate resolution of organ-specific autoimmunity in mice. After resolution of the inflammatory response, activated T-reg cells are maintained in the target tissue and are primed to attenuate subsequent autoimmune reactions when antigen is re-expressed. Thus, T-reg cells function to confer 'regulatory memory' to the target tissue. These findings provide a framework for understanding how T-reg cells respond when exposed to self antigen in peripheral tissues and offer mechanistic insight into how tissues regulate autoimmunity.

Among dermatitis patients, the prevalence of metal allergy is even higher. Metal allergy is mainly an environmental disorder although null Mutations in the filaggrin gene complex were recently found to be associated with nickel allergy and dermatitis. Environmental metal exposures include jewelry, buttons, clothing fasteners, dental restorations, mobile phones, and leather. Although consumer exposure is responsible for most cases of metal allergy, the importance Of Occupational metal exposure remains present and should always be taken into consideration when one interprets allergic patch test reactions to metals. Traditionally, nickel, cobalt, and chromium have been the most important contact allergens. However, recently, gold and palladium have drawn much attention as the prevalence of contact allergy to these metals is high. Palladium allergy is mainly a result of cross-sensitization to nickel, whereas gold allergy is rarely clinically relevant when one takes its high prevalence into account. The epidemiology of metal allergy has recently changed in Europe as nickel allergy among ear-pierced Danish women has decreased following regulatory intervention oil nickel release from consumer products. In the United States, the prevalence of nickel allergy is still increasing, which may be explained by the absence of regulation. The prevalence of chromium allergy is increasing in the United States, Singapore, and Denmark among dermatitis patients. This increase is significantly associated with leather exposure in Denmark. Metal allergy may result in allergic contact dermatitis and systemic allergic (contact) dematitis. Furthermore, metal allergy has been associated with device failure following insertion of intracoronary stents, hip and knee prostheses, as well as other implants. This area is in need of more research.

John			Mothers' anxiety during pregnancy is associated with asthma in their children	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Anxiety; pregnancy; prenatal programming; asthma; child	DAY-CARE ATTENDANCE; MATERNAL ANTENATAL ANXIETY; POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; COMORBID ANXIETY; INCREASED RISK; BIRTH-COHORT; EARLY-LIFE; STRESS; DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD	Background: Maternal stress in early life has been associated with the development of asthma in children, although it is unclear whether there are any critical periods of exposure. The association of asthma with prenatal exposure to maternal stress has not been reported. Objective: We tested whether prenatal and postnatal anxiety and/or depression in pregnant women predicted the risk of their offspring developing asthma in childhood. Methods: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children is a population-based birth cohort recruited during pregnancy. Data were available on maternal anxiety scores and asthma at age 71/2 years in 5810 children. Anxiety was assessed at 18 and 32 weeks of gestation by using the validated Crown-Crisp Experiential Index. Asthma was defined at age 71/2 years as doctor-diagnosed asthma with current symptoms or treatment in the previous 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of prenatal anxiety with asthma (odds ratio; 95% CI). Results: Independent of postnatal anxiety and adjusted for a number of likely confounders, there was a higher likelihood of asthma at age 71/2 years (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.25-2.17) in children of mothers in the highest compared with lowest quartile of anxiety scores at 32 weeks of gestation, with evidence for a dose-response (P value for trend <0.001). Conclusions: Maternal anxiety symptoms as an indicator of stress during fetal life may program the development of asthma during childhood. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;123:847-853.)	[Henderson, A.

Phenotypes of COPD classified purely based on severity of emphysema are not well defined and may be different from the classic phenotypes of "pink puffers'' and "blue bloaters''. Methods: To characterise clinical phenotypes based on severity of emphysema, 274 subjects with COPD were recruited, excluding those with physician-diagnosed bronchial asthma. For all subjects a detailed interview of disease history and symptoms, quality of life (QOL) measurement, blood sampling, pulmonary function tests before and after inhalation of salbutamol (0.4 mg) and high- resolution CT scanning were performed. Results: Severity of emphysema visually evaluated varied widely even among subjects with the same stage of disease. No significant differences were noted among three groups of subjects classified by severity of emphysema in age, smoking history, chronic bronchitis symptoms, blood eosinophil count, serum IgE level or bronchodilator response. However, subjects with severe emphysema had significantly lower body mass index (BMI) and poorer QOL scores, evaluated using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), than those with no/mild emphysema (mean ( SD) BMI 21.2 (0.5) vs 23.5 (0.3) kg/m(2), respectively; SGRQ total score 40 (3) vs 28 (2), respectively; p < 0.001 for both). These characteristics held true even if subjects with the same degree of airflow limitation were chosen. Conclusions: The severity of emphysema varies widely even in patients with the same stage of COPD, and chronic bronchitis symptoms are equally distributed irrespective of emphysema severity. Patients with the phenotype in which emphysema predominates have lower BMI and poorer health-related QOL.

SPDEF regulates goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway epithelium	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-I; SURFACTANT PROTEIN-C; SP-A GENE; RESPIRATORY EPITHELIUM; MOUSE LUNG; TRANSGENIC MICE; ETS-DOMAIN; EXPRESSION; DIFFERENTIATION; FACTOR-1	Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucous hypersecretion contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary diseases including cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the present work, mouse SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) mRNA and protein were detected in subsets of epithelial cells lining the trachea, bronchi, and tracheal glands. SPDEF interacted with the C-terminal domain of thyroid transcription factor 1, activating transcription of genes expressed selectively in airway epithelial cells, including Sftpa, Scgb1a1, Foxj1, and Sox17. Expression of Spdef in the respiratory epithelium of adult transgenic mice caused goblet cell hyperplasia, inducing both acidic and neutral mucins in vivo, and stainined for both acidic and neutral mucins in vivo. SPDEF expression was increased at sites of goblet cell hyperplasia caused by IL-13 and dust mite allergen in a process that was dependent upon STAT-6. SPDEF was induced following intratracheal allergen exposure and after Th2 cytokine stimulation and was sufficient to cause goblet cell differentiation of Clara cells in vivo.

Examining the underlying molecular mechanisms linking stress to asthma and other allergic phenomena is an active area of research. Evidence is reviewed for the influence of stress on neuroimmunoregulation and oxidative stress pathways, which, in turn, may affect biological hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli characteristic of atopic disorders. Critical periods of development, including in utero environment, are underscored. The role of genetics and gene-by-environment interactions is also discussed.

In a prospective birth-cohort study, we assessed the association between longitudinal cat allergen exposure, sensitization (immunoglobulin E, IgE), IgG antibody (ab) levels to cat and the development of asthma in children up to the age of 10 years. Methods: Of 1314 newborn infants enrolled in five German cities in 1990, follow-up data at age 10 years were available for 750 children. Assessments included yearly measurements of specific serum IgE to cat and at age 6 and 18 months, 3, 4 and 10 years measurement of cat allergen Fel d 1 in house dust samples. Additionally, Fel d 1-specific IgG ab were determined in 378 serum samples of 207 children. Endotoxin exposure in mattress dust was measured in a subgroup of 153 children at age 10 years. From age 4 years on, International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires were completed yearly in order to assess the prevalence of wheeze and asthma. Results: Serum IgG-levels to cat showed a large variation, however, intraindividually values showed rather constant concentration over a longer time period. The IgG levels at school-age correlated with cat allergen exposure during the first 2 years of life. Specific IgE to cat was clearly associated with wheeze ever, current wheeze and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), this was also observed for children with specific IgE ab to cat (&GT; 0.35 kU/l) plus IgG levels above 125 U/ml. A large percentage of very highly exposed children showed high IgG but no IgE responses to cat, however, not all highly exposed children were found to be protected from sensitization. Children with IgG but without IgE ab to cat showed the lowest prevalence of wheeze ever and current wheeze despite high cat allergen exposure, however, this trend did not achieve significance. While homes of cat owners showed higher Fel d 1 concentrations than homes without cats, homes of cat owners were not found to have higher endotoxin levels in carpet dust samples than homes without cats. Conclusions: We could confirm that high cat allergen exposure in a cohort with lower community prevalence of cats is associated with higher serum IgG and IgE levels to cat in schoolchildren. Sensitization to cat allergen (IgE) is a risk factor for childhood asthma. While exposure to cat allergen during infancy is associated with sensitization (IgE), only in the very highly exposed children the likelihood of sensitization (IgE) is decreased and high IgG levels to cat without IgE were associated with low risk of wheeze. However, cat-specific IgG ab levels did not protect children with IgE-mediated sensitization from wheeze.

Oral tolerance can be considered the default immune response to dietary antigens, with immune deviation resulting in allergic sensitization. However, primary sensitization to food allergens may not solely be through the gastrointestinal mucosa, as strong T-helper type 2 (Th2)-biased immunity can result from exposure to protein allergens on barrier-disrupted skin. The purpose of this study was to examine whether exposure to allergens through the skin may interfere with the normal development of oral tolerance and promote allergic sensitization to food proteins. Female BALB/c mice were exposed epicutaneously to peanut protein and induction of systemic oral tolerance through high dose feeds of peanut protein was subsequently assessed. Other mice were rendered tolerant prior to epicutaneous peanut exposure. Sensitivity to peanut was determined by assessing delayed-type hypersensitivity, proliferative, cytokine and antibody responses. Epicutaneous exposure to peanut protein induced potent Th2-type immunity with high levels of IL-4 and serum IgE. Primary skin exposure prevented the subsequent induction of oral tolerance to peanut in an antigen-specific manner. Upon oral challenge, mice became further sensitized and developed strong peanut-specific IL-4 and IgE responses. Furthermore, animals with existing tolerance to peanut were partly sensitized following epicutaneous exposure. Epicutaneous exposure to peanut protein can prevent induction of oral tolerance, and may even modify existing tolerance to peanut. Epidermal exposure to protein allergens selectively drives Th2-type responses, and as such may promote sensitization to food proteins upon gastrointestinal exposure.

Today copper is used as a water purifier, algaecide, fungicide, nematocide, molluscicide, and antibacterial and antifouling agent. Copper also displays potent antiviral activity. We hypothesized that introducing copper into clothing, bedding, and other articles would provide them with biocidal properties. A durable platform technology has been developed that introduces copper into cotton fibers, latex, and other polymeric materials. This study demonstrates the broad-spectrum antimicrobial ( antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal) and antimite activities of copper-impregnated fibers and polyester products. This technology enabled the production of antiviral gloves and filters (which deactivate HIV-1 and other viruses), antibacterial self-sterilizing fabrics (which kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci), antifungal socks (which alleviate symptoms of athlete's foot), and anti-dust mite mattress covers (which reduce mite-related allergies). These products did not have skin-sensitizing properties, as determined by guine pig maximization and rabbit skin irritation tests. Our study demonstrates the potential use of copper in new applications. These applications address medical issues of the greatest importance, such as viral transmissions; nosocomial, or healthcare-associated, infections; and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

We show that gently removing the stratum corneum with adhesive tape permits potent epicutaneous immunization to protein antigens. IL-4 secretion by T cells from draining lymph nodes and high levels of specific IgE and IgG1 with no IgG2a showed that the immune responses induced following epicutaneous antigen exposure are strongly Th2 biased. Similar responses were obtained With different antigens and mouse strains. In contrast, subcutaneous immunization with antigen delivery into the dermis was less potent and gave predominantly Th1 responses. Removal of the stratum corneum increased expression of MHC class II, CD86, CD40, CD54 and CD11c on Langerhans cells, but did not cause them to migrate. Rapid migration from epidermis to draining lymph node was obtained, however, by exposure to antigen after removal of the stratum corneum, suggesting that maturation and migration of Langerhans cells are independently regulated events. These results suggest that antigen presentation by Langerhans cells gives predominantly Th2 responses. This may provide an explanation for allergic sensitization to some antigens. It may also be a useful non-invasive, non-adjuvant-dependent method of vaccination.

We examined the role of class IA PI3K in antigen-induced air-way inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by i.p. administration into mice of Deltap85 protein, a dominant negative form of the class IA PI3K regulatory subunit, p85alpha, which was fused to HIV-TAT (TAT-Deltap85). Intraperitoneal administration of TXT-Deltap85 caused time-dependent transduction into blood leukocytes, and inhibited activated phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream target of PI3K, in lung tissues in mice receiving intranasal FMLP. Antigen challenge elicited pulmonary infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils, increase in mucus-containing epithelial cells, and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Except for modest airway neutrophilia, these effects all were blocked by treatment with 3-10 mg/kg of TAT-Deltap85. There was also significant reduction in IL-5 and IL-4 secretion into the BAL. Intranasal administration of IL-5 caused eosinophil migration into the air-way lumen, which was attenuated by systemic pretreatment with TAT-Deltap85. We conclude that PI3K has a regulatory role in Th2-cell cytokine secretion, airway inflammation, and air-way hyperresponsiveness in mice.

It also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders. Asthma and these psychological states and traits may mutually potentiate each other through direct psychophysiological mediation, nonadherence to medical regimen, exposure to asthma triggers, and inaccuracy of asthma symptom perception. Defensiveness is associated with inaccurate perception of airway resistance and stress-related bronchoconstriction. Asthma education programs that teach about the nature of the disease, medications, and trigger avoidance tend to reduce asthma morbidity.

We investigated the extent to which exposure to Alternaria increases the severity of asthma. We undertook a prospective cohort study in Australia of 399 school children who had positive skin tests to one or more aeroallergens. Airway responsiveness to histamine, wheeze, and bronchodilator use in 1 mo was measured five times between 1997 and 1999. Airway hyperresponsiveness was defined as PD20FEV1 = 3.9 mu mol histamine. Airborne concentrations of Alternaria spores were measured throughout the study, and mean daily concentrations over 1 mo ranged from 2.2 to 307.7 spores/m(3) of ambient air. Using generalized estimating equations, we found that airway responsiveness, wheeze, and bronchodilator use increased significantly in association with increased spore concentrations and that the increase in airway responsiveness was greater in children sensitized to Alternarxia than in other children (p = 0.01). The odds ratio for airway hyperresponsiveness in children sensitized to Alternaria was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.39) after an increase in mean exposure of 100 spore/m(3)/d over 1 mo. These results suggest that Alternaria allergens contribute to severe asthma in regions where exposure to the fungus is high.

Part of the remodeling process involves the laying down of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins within the airways. In this study we compared the production of ECM proteins by human airway smooth-muscle (ASM) cells in culture after exposure to 10% serum from an asthmatic individual or 10% serum from a nonasthmatic individual with or without beclomethasone (0.01 to 100 nM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were done with antibodies to human fibronectin; perlecan; elastin; the laminin beta (1), gamma (1), beta (2), alpha (1), chains; thrombospondin; chondroitin sulfate; collagen types I, III, IV, and V; versican; and decorin. Serum from the asthmatic individual, when compared with that from the nonasthmatic individual, caused a significant increase in the production of fibronectin, perlecan, laminin gamma (1), and chondroitin sulfate. Beclomethasone caused a significant reduction in the number of cells exposed to serum from either the asthmatic or nonasthmatic individual, but did not reverse the increase in ECM protein induced by the former. These results suggest an interaction between the ASM and the allergic process that may alter components of the airway wall in asthma, and that corticosteroids may not prevent the fibrosis induced by resident cells within the airways.

We investigated whether the levels of YKL-40 were up-regulated in the circulation and the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and whether it promoted the production of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. Serum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial biopsies, lung tissue specimens, and alveolar macrophages from never-smokers (n = 15), smokers without COPD (n = 20), and smokers with COPD (n = 30) were assessed for YKL-40 levels and immunolocalization. In addition, YKL-40-induced mediator release from alveolar macrophages was examined. We found that smokers with COPD had elevated levels of YKL-40 in serum (p <= 0.027) and BAL (p <= 0.007), more YKL-40-positive cells in bronchial biopsies (p <= 0.03), and a greater proportion of alveolar macrophages expressing YKL-40 than smokers without COPD or never-smokers. YKL-40 levels in serum and BAL were associated with airflow obstruction (pre-beta(2) agonist forced expiratory volume in 1 s, r(s) = -0.3892,p = 0.0072 and r(s) = -0.5491, p < 0.0001, respectively) and impaired diffusion lung capacity (transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide, r(s) = -0.4667, p = 0.002 and r(s) = -0.3854, p = 0.0045, respectively). TNF-alpha stimulated YKL-40 synthesis in alveolar macrophages from smokers with COPD, and exposure of these cells to YKL-40 promoted the release of IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and metalloproteinase-9. We conclude that YKL-40 is up-regulated in COPD, in which it may contribute to tissue inflammation and remodeling by sustaining the synthesis of proinflammatory and fibrogenic chemokines and of metalloproteinases by alveolar macrophages.

Urban air pollution, and asthma and COPD hospital emergency room visits	THORAX			English	Article							ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; PARTICULATE MATTER; SHORT-TERM; NUMBER; HEALTH; ADMISSIONS; INFLAMMATION; POLLUTANTS; EXPOSURE; DISEASE	Background: There is little previous information of the effects of size fractioned particulate air pollution and source specific fine particles (PM(2.5); <2.5 mu m) on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among children, adults and the elderly. Objectives: To determine the effects of daily variation in levels of different particle size fractions and gaseous pollutants on asthma and COPD by age group. Methods: Levels of particulate air pollution, NO(2) and CO were measured from 1998 to 2004 at central outdoor monitoring sites in Helsinki, Finland. Associations between daily pollution levels and hospital emergency room visits were evaluated for asthma (ICD10: J45+J46) in children,15 years old, and for asthma and COPD (ICD10: J41+J44) in adults (15-64 years) and the elderly (>= 65 years). Results: Three to 5 day lagged increases in asthma visits were found among children in association with nucleation (<0.03 mu m), Aitken (0.03-0.1 mu m) and accumulation (0.1-0.29 mu m) mode particles, gaseous pollutants and traffic related PM(2.5) (7.8% (95% CI 3.5 to 12.3) for 1.1 mu g/m(3) increase in traffic related PM(2.5) at lag 4). Pooled asthma-COPD visits among the elderly were associated with lag 0 of PM(2.5), coarse particles, gaseous pollutants and long range transported and traffic related PM(2.5) (3.9% (95% CI 0.28 to 7.7) at lag 0). Only accumulation mode and coarse particles were associated with asthma and COPD among adults. Conclusions: Among children, traffic related PM(2.5) had delayed effects, whereas among the elderly, several types of particles had effects that were more immediate. These findings suggest that the mechanisms of the respiratory effects of air pollution, and responsible pollutants, differ by age group.	[Halonen, J.

This change in lifestyles precludes exposure to helminths (parasitic worms). Loss of natural helminth exposure removes a previously universal Th2 and regulatory immune biasing imparted by these organisms. Helminths protect animals from developing immune-mediated diseases (colitis, reactive airway disease, encephalitis and diabetes). Clinical trials show that exposure to helminths can reduce disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.

Symptom-based questionnaire for identifying COPD in smokers	RESPIRATION			English	Article						chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diagnosis; primary care; questionnaires; spirometry; validation studies	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; GENERAL-PRACTICE; RISK; POPULATION; GUIDELINES; DIAGNOSIS; SMOKING; PROGRAM; ASTHMA	Background: Symptom-based questionnaires may enhance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) screening in primary care. Objectives: We prospectively tested questions to help identify COPD among smokers without prior history of lung disease. Methods: Subjects were recruited via random mailing to primary care practices in Aberdeen, UK, and Denver, Colo., USA. Current and former smokers aged 40 or older with no prior respiratory diagnosis and no respiratory medications in the past year were enrolled. Participants answered questions covering demographics and symptoms and then underwent spirometry with reversibility testing. A study diagnosis of COPD was defined as fixed airway obstruction as measured by postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70. We examined the ability of individual questions in a multivariate framework to correctly discriminate between persons with and without COPD. Results: 818 subjects completed all investigations and proceeded to analysis. The list of 54 questions yielded 52 items for analysis, which was reduced to 17 items for entry into multivariate regression. Eight items had significant relationships with the study diagnosis of COPD, including age, pack-years, body mass index, weather-affected cough, phlegm without a cold, morning phlegm, wheeze frequency, and history of any allergies. Individual items yielded odds ratios ranging from 0.23 to 12. This questionnaire demonstrated a sensitivity of 80.4 and specificity of 72.0. Conclusions: A simple patient self-administered questionnaire can be used to identify patients with a high likelihood of having COPD, for whom spirometric testing is particularly important. Implementation of this questionnaire could enhance the efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of current screening efforts. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Despite this, little is known on their clinical features, especially in infants and children. Objective: To evaluate trigger factors, patterns of clinical reaction, site of occurrence and treatment modalities of reported reaction in infants and children below 12 years of age in Germany. Methods: Paediatricians throughout Germany were asked by questionnaire to report accidental anaphylactic reactions over the previous 12 months. Severity of reported reactions was classified in grades I-IV according to reported symptoms. Results: Hundred and three cases of anaphylaxis were evaluated. Median age was 5 years, 58% were boys. Site of occurrence was the child's home in the majority of cases (58%). Foods were the most common causative allergen (57%), followed by insect stings (13%) and immunotherapy (SIT) (12%); in 8% anaphylactic agent was unknown. Among foods, peanuts and tree nuts were the most frequent allergens (20% of food allergens in each case). Severe reactions with cardiovascular involvement occurred in 24% of cases. No fatal reaction was observed. Recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis were reported in 27% of cases, half of these caused by the same allergen again. For treatment, 20% of children received adrenaline, in 8% of cases intravenously. Thirty-six per cent of patients with grade-IV reactions received adrenaline, 24% intravenously. In 17% of all children an adrenaline self-injector was prescribed after the episode. Conclusion: Our data: (i) shows an uncertainty of physicians in diagnosing anaphylaxis, (ii) reveals remarkable under-treatment of the majority of children with anaphylaxis, (iii) reflects the need for guidelines and training for physicians in managing children with anaphylaxis and (iv) should encourage the development of self-management programmes for patients and families.

It is well known that the single compounds (SCs) of the FM contribute differently to the FM patch rest reactions. In this study, we were interested in the time trends of the FM, the SCs, Myroxylon pereirae resin (MP; balsam of Peru) and oil of turpentine (OT) as possible further indicators of perfume allergy and analysed the data collected by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology multicentre project from 1996 to 2002. During the study period (1996-2002), the FM [8% petrolatum (pet.)], MP (25% pet.) and OT (1% pet.) were tested in 59 298, 59 334 and 59 478 patients, respectively. SCs were tested in a selected group of patients, ranging from n = 1083 to n = 1924 per year. A significant increase in the proportions of patients with positive reactions to FM, MP and OT between 1996 and 1998 is noted, and a significant decline from 1999 to 2002 (Cochrane Armitage trend test, P < 0.0001). The highest frequency of sensitization to the FM was 13.1% in 1999, and the lowest 7.8% in 2002. The number of concomitant reactions to OT, a surrogate marker for terpenes, in FM-positive patients was significantly increased between 1997 and 1999. Reactions to SCs in FM-positive patients were observed in 29.9% (oak moss absolute) to 5.9% (geraniol). There was no time trend in reactions to SCs, although the relative share was increased for isoeugenol, cinnamic aldehyde and geraniol in 1999. In summary, we report for the first time, a significant decline in sensitization to the FM, very probably due to a reduced exposure (less potent allergens used in fine fragrances, possibly less use of natural ingredient-based cosmetics and lowered use concentration of important fragrance allergens). The differences in ranking of SCs could stimulate (a) a redefinition of the FM and (b) a differentiated preventive and regulatory approach, with oak moss and isoeugenol being regulated strictly by prohibition, concentration limits further reconsidered and/or health warnings and clearly less noxious substances like geraniol treated less restrictively.

Extracts from several allergenic fungi are used for in vivo and in vitro tests, as standard preparations are still not available. Objective The aims are to de. ne the pattern of in vivo and in vitro IgE reactivity to fungal species in an allergic population with respiratory symptoms; to determine the influence of different extract preparations on diagnostic results; and to evaluate whether there exists a relationship between the diagnostic pattern of reactivity and the pattern of specific IgE reactivity in immunoblots. Methods Skin prick tests were applied to a cohort of 4962 respiratory subjects, aged 3 - 80 years. Fungal extracts from Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Saccharomyces, and Trichophyton were used, along with extracts from pollens, mites, and animal dander. Demographical and diagnostic data were recorded. IgE detection was carried out with the same allergenic extracts plus Malassezia. Comparative skin tests and IgE detection were carried out using extracts from three commercial suppliers. IgE immunoblots were carried out with the same panel of commercial fungal extracts and were compared with in-house extracts. Data analysis was carried out by grouping the population on the basis of their reactivity to a single, to two or to more than two, mould species. Results Nineteen percent of the allergic population reacted to at least one fungal extract by means of the skin test. Alternaria and Candida accounted for the largest number of positive tests, and along with Trichophyton they were the main sensitizers in the subset of patients with an isolated sensitization. The prevalence of skin test reactivity increased for these three fungi in the subsets with two associated reactivities and, furthermore, in the subset showing reactivity to more than two mould species. In the latter group, a steady increase of the skin test reactivity was recorded for all the other fungal sources, suggesting a clustered reactivity. Comparative skin and IgE testing with different groups of subjects with a simple pattern of skin reactivity resulted in sensitivity differences between in vivo and in vitro tests, whereas discrepant results were recorded in the subsets of patients with multiple fungi sensitization. Although hampered by the limited reliability of fungal extracts, IgE immunoblots revealed differing patterns of reactivity when sera from the three subsets were used. This suggests a link between the diagnostic reactivity pattern and the IgE sensitization to extracts' components. Age and gender distribution differed among the Alternaria-, Candida-, and Trichophyton-sensitized subjects, but not in the subset with more than two fungi sensitizations. Conclusions The preliminary assessment of a new classification of the mould-sensitized population has been reached. The limiting quality of fungal extracts requires future studies using an allergenic molecule-based approach. The diagnostic process and the definition of the reactivity pattern would thus be easy, and it could lead to a novel specific immunotherapy approach.

The purpose of this review is to explore the respiratory health and socioeconomic consequences of work-related asthma by addressing a series of controversial issues: 1) what is the natural history of occupational asthma and in what ways does ongoing exposure to the causal agent impact clinical outcomes?; 2) how does the natural history of irritant-induced asthma differ in its health outcomes from immunologically-mediated occupational asthma?; 3) do working conditions have a significant impact on asthma regardless of the aetiology of the disease?; 4) what is the scope of work disability from work-related-asthma in social and economic terms?; 5) what is the clinician's role in reducing the respiratory health consequences of work-related asthma? 6) to what extent do existing compensation and other social insurance schemes successfully address occupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma?

However, platelet-leukocyte interactions have been demonstrated in cardiovascular disease, culminating in enhanced leukocyte recruitment. Objectives: This study was undertaken to assess the possibility and potential role of similar phenomena occurring in asthmatic patients, a murine model of allergic inflammation, and in vitro adhesion studies. Methods: Asthmatic patients had blood taken at various time points to document the degree of leukocyte activation and the presence of platelet-leukocyte aggregates through FACS analysis before and after allergen exposure. Similar studies were carried out in mice exposed to allergen after previous sensitization, with some groups being selectively depleted of platelets through both an immunologic (antiplatelet antiserum) and nonimmunologic (busulfan) method. Additionally, lavage fluid and airway tissue were analyzed to assess the degree of pulmonary leukocyte recruitment. The importance of platelets on leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium was then assessed with in vitro incubation of radiolabeled leukocytes in the presence of activated platelets on cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Results: We have observed circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates in the blood of allergic asthmatic patients during the allergen-induced late asthmatic response and in sensitized mice after allergen exposure. In platelet-depleted mice infiltration of leukocytes into airways after allergen challenge was significantly reduced and could be restored by means of infusion of platelets from allergic animals, indicating an essential role for platelets in leukocyte recruitment. CD11b expression on leukocytes involved in aggregates with platelets, although not on free leukocytes, was upregulated. Furthermore, the presence of autologous platelets augmented the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to cultured vascular endothelial cells, an effect that was found to be endothelial cell dependent and to involve platelet activation. Conclusion: These results suggest that platelet participation in cell recruitment occurs at the level of the circulation and might involve the priming of leukocytes for subsequent adhesion and transmigration into tissues.

At 24, 48, and 72 h post-OVA exposure, the severity of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation of the mouse strains ranged from relatively unresponsive to responsive. The severity of the airway eosinophilia of some strains did not clearly correlate with the development of AHR. The temporal presence of T helper type 2 cytokines in lung lavage fluid also varied markedly among the strains. The levels of IL-4 and IL-13 were generally increased in the strains with the highest airway eosinophilia at 24 and 72 h postexposure, respectively; the levels of IL-5 were significantly increased in most of the strains with airway inflammation over the 72-h time period. The differences of physiological and biological responses among the inbred mouse strains after OVA sensitization and challenge support the hypothesis that genetic factors contribute, in part, to the development of allergen-induced airway disease.

Release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerves activates postjunctional muscarinic receptors present on airway smooth muscle, submucosal glands, and blood vessels to cause bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and vasodilatation, respectively. Acetylcholine also feeds back onto prejunctional muscarinic receptors to enhance or inhibit further acetylcholine release. In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion is increased and the airways are hyperresponsive to contractile agents. These changes are due to increased parasympathetic nerve activity. The number and function of postjunctional muscarinic receptors in the airways are unchanged in animal models of asthma. Rather, it is the supply of acetylcholine to the postjunctional cells (smooth muscle and submucosal gland) that is increased. The increase in acetylcholine release occurs because prejunctional, inhibitory M-2 muscarinic receptors on the parasympathetic nerves are dysfunctional. M-2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction and subsequent airway hyperreactivity have been demonstrated to occur in animals in response to a variety of triggers, including antigen challenge, virus infection, ozone exposure, and vitamin A deficiency. In humans, there is evidence that loss of M-2 muscarinic receptor function is related to asthma. The mechanisms by which neuronal M-2 muscarinic receptor function is lost and its relevance to human airway disease are discussed in this review. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Prospective birth cohort study of 2602 live born children ascertained through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Main outcome measures were hospital, doctor, or clinic visits, and hospital admissions for respiratory illness and infection in the first year of life. Main exposure measures were the duration of predominant breast feeding (defined as the age other milk was introduced) and partial (any) breast feeding (defined as the age breast feeding was stopped). Main confounders were gender, gestational age less than 37 weeks, smoking in pregnancy, older siblings, maternal education, and maternal age. Results: Hospital, doctor, or clinic visits for four or more upper respiratory tract infections were significantly greater if predominant breast feeding was stopped before 2 months or partial breast feeding was stopped before 6 months. Predominant breast feeding for less than six months was associated with an increased risk for two or more hospital, doctor, or clinic visits and hospital admission for wheezing, lower respiratory illness. Breast feeding for less than eight months was associated with a significantly increased risk for two or more hospital, doctor, or clinic visits or hospital admissions because of wheezing lower respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: Predominant breast feeding for at least six months and partial breast feeding for up to one year may reduce the prevalence and subsequent morbidity of respiratory illness and infection in infancy.

Maternal smoking and family (especially maternal) history of atopy appear to be risk factors for persistent sensitization and development of asthma. Indeed, exposure to tobacco smoke in utero significantly increases asthma risk and influences the timing of sensitization. It must be stated that any smoking at home has consequences for the development of asthma and other respiratory conditions. In addition, reports of possible protective effects of specific environmental conditions suggest that exposure to certain stimuli may reduce or block the development and progression of asthma. Attendance at a day care center early in life appears to offer protective effects against wheezing, as do early episodes of rhinitis, herpes, and measles. Children raised on a farm also have a decreased prevalence of atopic diseases. The protective effect of contact with livestock and poultry is consistent among several studies. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved remain undefined, studies suggest that exposure to endotoxin and other components of bacteria may play an important role in protecting against childhood atopic diseases. Whether in utero exposure is beneficial remains to be determined.

The most important of the beneficial effects are increasing global and regional food supplies and increased nutritional quality of available foods. However, lack of adequate dietary intake of amino acids and proteins is a serious cause of malnutrition when food supplies are inadequate because of poverty, drought, floods, wars, and displacements of people as refugees. There is sufficient, though limited, quantitative data indicating that increased circulation of Nr in the environment is responsible for significant human health effects via other exposure pathways. Nr can lead to harmful health effects from airborne occupational exposures and population-wide indoor and outdoor air pollution exposures to nitrogen dioxide and ozone. Nr can also affect health via water pollution problems, including methemoglobinemia from contaminated ground water, eutrophication causing fish kills and algal blooms that can be toxic to humans, and via global warming. The environmental pollutants stemming from reactive nitrogen are ubiquitous, making it difficult to identify the extent to which Nr exerts a specific health effect. As all populations are susceptible, continued interdisciplinary investigations are needed to determine the extent and nature of the beneficial and harmful effects on human health of nitrogen-related pollutants and their derivatives.

Here we present measurements of growth and pollen production of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) from pre- industrial [CO2] (280 mu mol mol(-1)) to current concentrations (370 mu mol mol(-1)) to a projected 21st century concentration (600 mu mol mol(-1)). We found that exposure to current and elevated [CO2] increased ragweed pollen production by 131 and 320%, respectively, compared to plants grown at pre- industrial [CO2]. The observed stimulations of pollen production from the pre- industrial [CO2] were due to an increase in the number (at 370 mu mol mol(-1)) and number and size (at 600 mu mol mol(-1)) of floral spikes. Overall, floral weight as a percentage of total plant weight decreased (from 21% to 13%), while investment in pollen increased (from 3.6 to 6%) between 280 and 600 mu mol mol(-1) CO2. Our results suggest that the continuing increase in atmospheric [CO2] could directly influence public health by stimulating the growth and pollen production of allergy- inducing species such as ragweed.

Recent studies indicate that IL-33 induces production of large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 by group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), for initiation of allergic inflammation shortly after exposure to allergens or infection with parasites or viruses. IL-33 appears to function as an alarmin (alarm signal) rapidly released from producing cells upon cellular damage or cellular stress. In this review, we discuss the cellular sources, mode of action and regulation of IL-33, and we highlight its crucial roles in vivo with particular emphasis on results obtained using IL33-deficient mice.

Molecular diagnosis in allergy	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review							LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN; CONTROLLED FOOD CHALLENGE; NATURAL-RUBBER LATEX; COMPONENT-RESOLVED DIAGNOSIS; EXERCISE-INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS; PARIETARIA-JUDAICA POLLEN; COWS MILK ALLERGY; HOUSE-DUST MITE; ASPERGILLUS-FUMIGATUS ALLERGENS; PLANTAGO-LANCEOLATA POLLEN	Development and progress made in the field of recombinant allergens have allowed for the development of a new concept in allergy diagnosis, molecular diagnosis (MD), which makes it possible to identify potential disease-eliciting molecules. Microarray-based testing performed with a small amount of serum sample enables clinicians to determine specific-IgE antibodies against multiple recombinants or purified natural allergen components. Performance characteristics of allergens so far tested are comparable with current diagnostic tests, but have to be confirmed in larger studies. The use of allergen components and the successful interpretation of test results in the clinic require some degree of knowledge about the basis of allergen components and their clinical implications. Allergen components can be classified by protein families based on their function and structure. This review provides a brief overview of basic information on allergen components, recombinants or purified, currently available or soon to become commercially available in ImmunoCAP or ISAC (R) systems, including names, protein family and function. Special consideration is given to primary or species-specific sensitization and possible cross-reactivity, because one of the most important clinical utility of MD is its ability to reveal whether the sensitization is genuine in nature (primary, species-specific) or if it is due to cross-reactivity to proteins with similar protein structures, which may help to evaluate the risk of reaction on exposure to different allergen sources. MD can be a support tool for choosing the right treatment for the right patient with the right timing. Such information will eventually give clinicians the possibility to individualize the actions taken, including an advice on targeted allergen exposure reduction, selection of suitable allergens for specific immunotherapy, or the need to perform food challenges. Nevertheless, all in vitro tests should be evaluated together with the clinical history, because allergen sensitization does not necessarily imply clinical responsiveness.

The differentiating features of severe asthma in children are poorly defined. Objective: To identify features of severe versus mild-to-moderate asthma in school-age children using noninvasive assessments of lung function, atopy, and airway inflammation. Methods: A total of 75 children (median age, 10 years) with asthma underwent baseline characterization including spirometry and lung volume testing, methacholine bronchoprovocation, allergy evaluation, and offline measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (F-ENO). Twenty-eight were followed longitudinally over 6 months. Participants were assigned to the severe asthma subgroup if they required high-dose ICS plus 2 or more minor criteria. Results: Children with severe versus mild-to-moderate asthma had more symptoms, greater airway obstruction, more gas trapping, and increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine. Subjects with severe asthma also had higher concentrations of F-ENO and significantly greater sensitization to aeroallergens. With long-term study, both the reduction in FEVI and increase in F-ENO persisted in the severe versus mild-to-moderate group. Furthermore, despite adjustments in ICS doses, the frequency of exacerbations was significantly higher in subjects with severe (83%) versus mild-to-moderate asthma (43%). Conclusion: Severe asthma in childhood is characterized by poor symptom control despite high-dose ICS treatment and can be differentiated from mild-to-moderate asthma by measurement of lung function and F-ENO. Clinical implications: Clinicians should suspect severe asthma in children with poor response to ICS, airway obstruction, and high F-ENO.

In regard to skin sensitization tests, dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human peripheral blood have been considered in the development of new in vitro alternatives. Human cell lines have been also reported recently. In our previous study, we suggested that measuring CD86 and/or CD54 expression on THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) could be used as an in vitro skin sensitization method. An inter-laboratory study among two laboratories was undertaken in Japan in order to further develop an in vitro skin sensitization model. In the present study, we used two human cell lines: THP-1 and U-937 (human histiocytic lymphoma cell line). First we optimized our test protocol (refer to the related paper entitled "optimization of the h-CLAT protocol" within this journal) and then we did an inter-laboratory validation with nine chemicals using the optimized protocol. We measured the expression of CD86 and CD54 on the above cells using flow cytometry after a 24 h and 48 h exposure to six known allergens (e.g., DNCB, pPD, NiSO4) and three non-allergens (e.g., SLS, tween 80). For the sample test concentration, four doses (0.1x, 0.5x, 1x, and 2x of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)) were evaluated. IC50 was calculated using MTT assay. We found that allergens/non-allergens were better predicted using THP-1 cells compared to U-937 cells following a 24 h and a 48 h exposure. We also found that the 24 h treatment time tended to have a better accuracy than the 48 h treatment time for THP-1 cells. Expression of CD86 and CD54 were good predictive markers for THP-1 cells, but for U-937 cells, expression of CD86 was a better predictor than CD54, at the 24 h and the 48 h treatment time. The accuracy also improved when both markers (CD86 and CD54) were used as compared with a single marker for THP-1 cells. Both laboratories gave a good prediction of allergen/non-allergen, especially using THP-1 cells. These results suggest that our method, human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT), using human cell lines THP-1 and U-937, but especially THP-1 cells at 24 h treatment, may be a useful in vitro skin sensitization model to predict various contact allergens.

The aim of this study was to assess the possible effects of such exposure in utero on lower respiratory disease in children up to two years of age. Methods: A birth cohort of 4089 newborn infants was followed for two years using parental questionnaires. When the infant was two months old the parents completed a questionnaire on various lifestyle factors, including maternal smoking during pregnancy and after birth. At one and two years of age information was obtained by questionnaire on symptoms of allergic and respiratory diseases as well as on environmental exposures, particularly exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Adjustments were made for potential confounders. Results: When the mother had smoked during pregnancy but not after that, there was an increased risk of recurrent wheezing up to two years' age, ORadj = 2.2, (95% CI 1.3-3.6). The corresponding OR was 1.6, ( 95% CI 1.2-2.3) for reported exposure to ETS with or without maternal smoking in utero. Maternal smoking during pregnancy but no exposure to ETS also increased the risk of doctor's diagnosed asthma up to two years of age, ORadj = 2.1, ( 95% CI 1.2-3.7). Conclusion: Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking in utero is a risk factor for recurrent wheezing, as well as doctor's diagnosed asthma in children up to two years of age.

Osmotic challenge tests have an advantage over the traditional methods of measuring airway hyperresponsiveness using methacholine as they demonstrate higher specificity to identify asthma and thus the need for treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The safety and the efficacy of mannitol (M) as a BPT to measure airway hyperresponsiveness were compared to hypertonic (4.5%) saline (HS) in people both with and without signs and symptoms of asthma. Methods: A phase III, multi-centre, open label, operator-blinded, crossover design, randomised trial, with follow-up. Asthmatics and non-asthmatics (6-83 yr) were recruited and 592 subjects completed the study. Mannitol was delivered using a low resistance dry powder inhaler and HS was delivered using an ultrasonic nebuliser. The FEV1 was measured 60 seconds after each dose of mannitol (5,10,20,40,80,160,160,160 mg) and after each exposure to HS (0.5,1.0,2.0,4.0,8.0 minutes). A 15% fall in FEV1 defined a positive test. Adverse events were monitored and diaries kept for 7 days following the tests. Results: Mean pre-test FEV1 (mean +/- SD) was 95.5 +/- 14% predicted. 296 were positive to mannitol (M+) and 322 positive to HS (HS+). A post study physician conducted clinical assessment identified 82.3% asthmatic (44% classified mild) and 17.7% non-asthmatic. Of those M+, 70.1% were taking ICS and of those mannitol negative (M-), 81.1% were taking ICS. The % fall in FEV1 for mannitol in asthmatics was 21.0% +/- 5.7 and for the non-asthmatics, 5.5% +/- 4.8. The median PD15 M was 148 mg and PD15 HS 6.2 ml. The sensitivity of M to identify HS+ was 80.7% and the specificity 86.7%. The sensitivity of M compared with the clinical assessment was 59.8% and specificity 95.2% and increased to 88.7% and 95.0% respectively when the M- subjects taking ICS were excluded. Cough was common during testing. There were no serious adverse events. The diarised events were similar for mannitol and HS, the most common being headache (17.2% M, 19% HS), pharyngolaryngeal pain (5.1% M, 3% HS), nausea (4.3% M, 3% HS), and cough (2.2% M, 2.4% HS). Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of mannitol was demonstrated in non-asthmatic and clinically diagnosed asthmatic adults and children.

Therefore, we investigated the antiinflammatory effects of a respirable p38 alpha MAPK antisense oligonucleotide (p38 alpha-ASO) in a mouse asthma model. A potent and selective p38 alpha-ASO was characterized in vitro. Inhalation of aerosolized p38 alpha-ASO using an aerosol chamber dosing system produced measurable lung deposition of ASO and significant reduction of ovalbumin (OVA-)-induced increases in total cells, eosinophils, and interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and dose-dependent inhibition of airway hyperresponsiveness in allergen-challenged mice. Furthermore, inhaled p38 alpha-ASO markedly inhibited OVA-induced lung tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus hypersecretion. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells and peribronchial lymph node cells showed that p38 alpha-ASO significantly reduced p38 alpha MAPK mRNA expression. Nose-only aerosol exposure of mice verified the p38 alpha-ASO-induced inhibition of OVA-induced pulmonary eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness. None of the effects of the p38 alpha-ASO were produced by a six-base mismatched control oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate antisense pharmacodynamic activity in the airways after aerosol delivery and suggest that a p38 alpha MAPK ASO approach may have therapeutic potential for asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases.

Aim: The aims of our study were: (i) to measure the comorbidity of AR and asthma and asthma-like symptoms and (ii) to assess whether asthma, AR, and their coexistence share a common pattern of individual risk factors. Methods: The subjects are participants from the Italian multicentre, cross-sectional survey on respiratory symptoms in the young adult general population (Italian Study of Asthma in Young Adults, ISAYA). The relationship between individual risk factors and asthma, AR and their coexistence, was studied by means of a multinomial logistic regression. Results: About 60% of asthmatics reported AR. On the other hand, subjects with AR presented an eightfold risk of having asthma compared to subjects without AR. Age was negatively associated with asthma [OR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82-0.96], AR (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.98), and asthma associated with AR (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79-0.88). The risk of AR without asthma was significantly higher in the upper social classes (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39). Active current smoking exposure was positively associated with asthma alone (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41) and negatively associated with AR with (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.88) or without (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69-0.84) asthma. Conclusions: Asthma and AR coexist in a substantial percentage of patients; bronchial asthma and AR, when associated, seem to share the same risk factors as AR alone while asthma without AR seems to be a different condition, at least with respect to some relevant risk factors.

IMMUNOTHERAPY; BINDING; ASTHMA; CHILDREN; POLLEN	Background Mites belong to the most frequent and potent allergen sources. Immunotherapy with mite allergen extracts is frequently performed if allergen avoidance is not possible or successful. However, highly controversial results have been reported for mite-specific immunotherapy. Objective The aim of this study was to develop diagnostic concepts that may contribute to an improved selection of patients for immunotherapy with Der p allergen extracts and that may be used for immunological monitoring of patients undergoing this treatment. Methods The IgE reactivity profiles to Der p extract were determined in a Middle European mite-allergic population by IgE immunoblotting and by using a panel of seven purified natural or recombinant Der p allergens (nDer p 1, nDer p 4, rDer p 2, rDer p 5, rDer p 7, rDer p 8, rDer p 10). Furthermore, we investigated the sensitization and cross-reactivity to house-dust- and storage-mite allergen extracts by CAP FEIA measurements and by IgE competition studies. Results More than 95% of the patients could be diagnosed with a combination of nDer p 1 and rDer p 2. With the methods used, we could discriminate mite-allergic patients who were mainly sensitized to the major Der p allergens (Der p 1, Der p 2) from patients with a broad sensitization profile, including highly cross-reactive allergens (e.g. Der p 10: tropomyosin) as well as reactivity to storage mites. Conclusions Diagnostic tests containing the major mite allergens (i.e. Der p 1, Der p 2) and highly cross-reactive mite allergens (e.g. Der p 10) may improve the diagnostic selection of patients for immunotherapy with Der p extracts. These tests may also be used for the immunological monitoring of patients undergoing immunotherapy.

To understand the worsening epidemiological trends of asthma, this study analysed the data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to determine the prevalence and risk factors for asthma and wheezing among US adults. This analysis used data from, 18,825 US adults aged greater than or equal to 20 yrs who had participated in the NHANES III project. After excluding subjects with physician-diagnosed emphysema, a total of 18,393 subjects were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of current asthma (asthma) was 4.5% and the prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months (wheezing) was 16.4%. Mexican-Americans exhibited the lowest prevalence of asthma when compared with other race/ethnic groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Mexican-Americans were less likely to report asthma when compared to non-Hispanic whites. Low education level, female sex, current and past smoking status, pet ownership, lifetime diagnosis of physician-diagnosed hay fever and obesity were all significantly associated with asthma and/or wheezing. No significant effect of indoor air pollutants, as derived from the use of household heating/cooking appliances, on asthma and wheezing was observed in this study. In conclusion, this study observed racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of asthma and wheezing and identified several important risk factors that may contribute to development and/or exacerbation of asthma and wheezing. Contrary to earlier reports, the proxy measures of indoor air pollution used in this study were not found to be associated with increased risk of asthma and wheezing.

Individuals who are considered most sensitive to particulate pollution are those with pre-existing airways inflammation, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung infection or asthma. These diseases are characterized by a presence of inflammatory cells in the airways including neutrophils (PMN), eosinophils and monocytes (Mo), and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (AM). These cells have a high capacity for production of oxygen radicals, as compared to other cell types of the lung. To assess the oxidative response of these various cell types to pollution particles of various sources, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was employed. Particles including transition metal-rich residual oil fly ashes (ROFAs), coal fly ashes, diesel, SiO2, TiO2 and fugitive dusts were co-cultured with AM, Mo and PMN in a dose range of 10-100 mug/2x 10(5) cells and chemiluminescence determined following a 20-min interaction. A strong oxidant response of AM was restricted to oil fly ashes, while the PMN were most reactive to the dusts containing aluminium silicate. In general, the Mo response was less vigorous, but overlapped both AM- and PMN-stimulating dusts. However, in response to SiO2, and volcanic ash the Mo chemiluminescence exceeded that of the other cell types. Oxygen radicals generated in response to ROFA by the AM were likely to be dependent on mitochondrial processes, while the response in PMN involved the membrane NADPH oxidase complex, as determined by targeting inhibitors. The response of AM to SiO2 of various sizes and TiO2 in the fine size range obtained from different commercial sources, was highly variable, implying that composition rather than size was responsible for the oxidant response. A strong chemiluminescence response was not consistently associated with cytotoxicity in the responsive cell. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidant activation by various sources of particulate matter is cell specific. Therefore, the inflamed lung is likely to be more susceptible to harm of ambient air particulates because of the oxidant stress posed by a broader range of particles.

The understanding of the natural history of the atopic march, including the determinants that are modifiable and might become candidates for preventive intervention, is still very limited, Information provided by cross-sectional studies can only generate hypotheses, which need to be supported by prospective, longitudinal, cohort studies. Ultimately, it will depend on the results of well-controlled intervention studies to identify which nutritional, environmental, or lifestyle-related factors should be considered for early intervention and might be useful to reverse the epidemiologic trend.

All homes were located in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area and were sampled each month from April 1995 to June 1996. Outdoor air was collected at two locations. We found greater within-home than between-home variance for bedroom floor, kitchen floor, and airborne endotoxin. However, the reverse was true for bed dust endotoxin. Thus, studies using single measurements of dust endotoxin are most likely to reliably distinguish between homes if bed dust is sampled. Dust endotoxin levels were not significantly associated with airborne endotoxin. Airborne endotoxin was significantly (p = 0.04) and positively associated with absolute humidity in a mixed-effect model adjusting for a random home effect and fixed effect of sampling month and home characteristics. This finding implies that indoor humidity may be an important factor controlling endotoxin exposure. We found a significant (p < 0.05) seasonal effect in kitchen door dust (spring > fall) and bedroom airborne endotoxin (spring > winter), but not in the other indoor samples. We found significant seasonal pattern in outdoor airborne endotoxin (summer > winter).

Design: We studied an Internet-based telemonitoring system that collected spirometry. data and symptom reports from asthma patients' homes for review by physicians in the medical center's clinical information system. After a 40-min training session, patients completed an electronic diary and performed spirometry testing twice daily on their own from their homes for 3 weeks. A medical professional visited each patient by the end of the third neck of monitoring, 10 to 40 min after the patient had performed self-testing, and asked the patient to perform the spirometry test again under his supervision, We evaluated the validity of self-testing and surveyed the patients attitude toward the technology using a standardized questionnaire, Setting: Telemonitoring was conducted in patients' homes in a low-income inner city area, Patients: Thirty-one consecutive asthma patients without regard to computer experience. Measurement and results: Thirty-one asthma patients completed 3 weeks of monitoring, A paired t test showed no difference between unsupervised and supervised home spirometry self-testing, The variability of FVC (4.1%), FEV(1), (3.7%), peak expiratory flow (7.9%), and other spirometric indexes in our study was similar to the within-subject variability reported by other researchers. Despite the fact that the majority of the patients (71%) had no computer experience, they indicated that the self-testing was "not complicated at all" or only "slightly complicated." The majority of patients (87.1%) were strongly interested in using home asthma telemonitoring in the future. Conclusions: Spirometry self-testing by asthma patients during telemonitoring is valid and comparable to those tests collected under the supervision of a trained medical professional, Internet-based home asthma telemonitoring can be successfully implemented in a group of patients with no computer background.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are suppressors of immune responses involved in asthma pathogenesis. Treg-cell impairment is associated with increased DNA methylation of Forkhead box transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), a key transcription factor in Treg-cell activity. Because AAP exposure can induce epigenetic changes, we hypothesized that Treg-cell function would be impaired by AAP, allowing amplification of an inflammatory response. Objectives: To assess whether exposure to AAP led to hypermethylation of the Foxp3 gene, causing impaired Treg-cell suppression and worsened asthma symptom scores. Methods: Children with and without asthma from Fresno, Calif (high pollution, Fresno Asthma Group [FA], n = 71, and Fresno Non Asthmatic Group, n = 30, respectively), and from Stanford, Calif (low pollution, Stanford Asthma Group, n = 40, and Stanford Non Asthmatic Group, n 5 40), were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Peripheral blood Treg cells were used in functional and epigenetic studies. Asthma outcomes were assessed by Global Initiative in Asthma score. Results: Fresno Asthma Group Treg-cell suppression was impaired and FA Treg-cell chemotaxis were reduced compared with other groups (P <= .05). Treg-cell dysfunction was associated with more pronounced decreases in asthma Global Initiative in Asthma score in FA versus the Stanford Asthma Group. Foxp3 was decreased in FA compared with the Fresno Non Asthmatic Group (P <= .05). FA also contained significantly higher levels of methylation at the Foxp3 locus (P <= .05). Conclusion: Increased exposure to AAP is associated with hypermethylation of the Foxp3 locus, impairing Treg-cell function and increasing asthma morbidity. AAP could play a role in mediating epigenetic changes in Treg cells, which may worsen asthma by an immune mechanism. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;126:845-52.)

The efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy for house dust mites respiratory allergy: results of a GA(2);LEN meta-analysis	ALLERGY			English	Review						efficacy; house dust mites; meta-analysis; specific immunotherapy	RANDOMIZED-CLINICAL-TRIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; RHINITIS; ASTHMA; CHILDREN; COLLABORATION; ORGANIZATION; REVIEWS; QUALITY	Recent meta-analyses documented the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (AA). Although SLIT appeared globally effective, the sub-analyses for single allergens provided uncertain results. This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy of SLIT with house dust mite (HDM) extracts in AR and AA through an updated reassessment of randomized controlled trials. Electronic databases were searched up to March 31, 2008, for randomized DBPC trials, assessing the efficacy of SLIT in AR and AA due to HDM sensitization. Outcomes were symptom scores and rescue medications use. For AR, eight studies fulfilled the selection criteria. A significant reduction in symptoms of AR (SMD -0.95; CI 95%-1.77 to -0.14 P = 0.02) was found in 194 patients (adults and children) receiving SLIT compared to 188 receiving placebo. For AA, with nine studies, similar results were found for symptoms (SMD -0.95; CI 95%-1.74 to -0.15 P = 0.02) in 243 patients (adults and children) receiving SLIT compared to 209 receiving placebo. A reduction in rescue medication use was found for AR (SMD -1.88; CI 95%-3.65 to -0.12 P = 0.04) in 89 patients, and AA (SMD -1.48; CI 95%-2.70 to -0.26 P = 0.02) in 202 patients. A relevant inter-study heterogeneity was detected. Promising evidence of efficacy for SLIT, using mite extract in allergic patients suffering from AR and AA, are herein shown. These findings suggest that more data are needed, derived from large-population-based high quality studies, and corroborated by objective outcomes, mainly for AA.

The role of exposure to phthalates from polyvinyl chloride products in the development of asthma and allergies: A systematic review and meta-analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Review						allergy; asthma; phthalates; polyvinyl chloride	MEAT-WRAPPERS ASTHMA; SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION MODEL; INTERIOR SURFACE MATERIALS; BALB/C MICE; DI-(2-ETHYLHEXYL) PHTHALATE; MONO-2-ETHYLHEXYL PHTHALATE; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; YOUNG-CHILDREN	BACKGROUND: Phthalates from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics may have adverse effects on airways and immunologic systems, but the evidence has not been reviewed systematically. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the evidence for the role of exposure to phthalates from PVC products in the development of asthma and allergies. Methods: We conducted a Medline database search (1950 through May 2007) for relevant studies on the respiratory and allergic effects of exposure to phthalates from PVC products. RESULTS: We based this review on 27 human and 14 laboratory toxicology studies. Two mouse inhalation experiments indicated that mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) has the ability to modulate the immune response to exposure to a coallergen. The data suggested a no observed effect level of 30 mu g MEHp/m(3), calculated to be below the estimated level of human exposure in common environments. Case reports and series (n = 9) identified and verified cases of asthma that were very likely caused by fumes emitted from PVC film. Epidemiologic studies in adults (n = 10), mostly small studies in occupational settings, showed associations between heated PVC fumes and asthma and respiratory symptoms; studies in children (n = 5) showed an association between PVC surface materials in the home and the risk of asthma [fixed-effects model: summary odds ratio (OR), 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-2-05; four studies] and allergies (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60; three studies). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of phthalates from PVC products can modulate the murine immune response to a coallergen. Heated PVC fumes possibly contribute to development of asthma in adults. Epidemiologic studies in children show associations between indicators of phthalate exposure in the home and risk of asthma and allergies. The lack of objective exposure information limits the epidemiologic data.	[Jaakkola, Jouni J.

The inhaled soot, dust, microbes, and gases can all damage the airway epithelium. Consequently, mucus secretion is extremely rapid, occurring in tens of milliseconds. In addition, mucus is held in cytoplasmic granules in a highly condensed state in which high concentrations of Ca2+ nullify the repulsive forces of the highly polyanionic mucin molecules. Upon initiation of secretion and dilution of the Ca2+, the repulsion forces of the mucin molecules cause many-hundred-fold swelling of the secreted mucus, to cover and protect the epithelium. Secretion is a highly regulated process, with coordination by several molecules, including soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), and Munc proteins, to dock the mucin granules to the secretory cell membrane prior to exocytosis. Because mucus secretion appears to be such a fundamental airway homeostatic process, virtually all regulatory and inflammatory mediators and interventions that have been investigated increase secretion acutely. When given longer-term, many of these same mediators also increase mucin gene expression and mucin synthesis, and induce goblet cell hyperplasia. These responses induce (in contrast to the protective effects of acute secretion) long-term, chronic hypersecretion of airway mucus, which contributes to respiratory disease. In this case the homeostatic, protective function of airway mucus secretion is lost, and, instead, mucus hypersecretion contributes to pathophysiology of a number of severe respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis.

Data are emerging that atopic skin may provide an early entry point for antigen sensitization. We aimed to test the hypothesis that epicutaneous exposure to antigen primes for subsequent respiratory antigen-induced EE. Methods: Wild-type and genetically engineered mice were subjected to epicutaneous antigen sensitization and the development of experimental EE, and immune responses were examined. Results: We show that exposure to antigen via the epicutaneous route primes for marked eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus triggered by a single airway antigen challenge. The development of experimental EE is associated with significant skin eosinophilia, accelerated bone marrow eosinophilopoiesis, blood eosinophilia, and large increases in serum antigen-specific immunoglobulin G1/immunoglobulin E using ovalbumin or Aspergillus fumigatus as the epicutaneous antigen. Mechanistic analysis with gene-targeted mice showed that interleukin-5 was required for esophageal eosinophilia and that interleukin-4, interleukin-13, and STAT6 contributed to a lesser extent. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence that epicutaneous exposure to allergens potently primes for EE via a Th2-dependent mechanism.

damp housing; effect modification; interaction; molds	ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; HEALTH; INFLAMMATION; SIGNS	Previous studies of how parental atopy and exposure to dampness and molds contribute to the risk of asthma have been mainly cross-sectional or prevalent case-control studies, where selection and information bias and temporality constitute problems. We assessed longitudinally the independent and joint effects of parental atopy and exposure to molds in dwellings on the development of asthma in childhood. We conducted a population-based, 6-year prospective cohort study of 1,984 children 1-7 years of age at the baseline in 1991 (follow-up rate, 77%). The study population included 1,916 children without asthma at baseline and complete outcome information. The data collection included a baseline and follow-up survey. The outcome of interest was development of asthma during the study period. The studied determinants were parental allergic diseases and four indicators of exposure at baseline: histories of water damage, presence of moisture and visible molds, and perceived mold odor in the home. A total of 138 (7.2%) children developed asthma during the study period, resulting in an incidence rate of 125 cases per 10,000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI), 104-146]. In Poisson regression adjusting for confounding, parental atopy [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.52; 95% Cl, 1.08-2.13] and the presence of mold odor in the home reported at baseline (adjusted IRR 2.44; 95% Cl, 1.07-5.60) were independent determinants of asthma incidence, but no apparent interaction was observed. The results of this cohort study with assessment of exposure before the onset of asthma strengthen the evidence on the independent effects of parental atopy and exposure to molds on the development of asthma.

The objectives of the study were to examine linkages between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders in a birth cohort of over 1000 young persons studied to the age of 21 years. Specifically, the study aimed to ascertain the extent to which associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders could be explained by non-observed fixed confounding factors. Method. Asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders were measured prospectively over the course of a 21-year longitudinal study. Fixed effects logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders, adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Results. Asthma in adolescence and young adulthood was associated with increased likelihood of major depression (OR 1(.)7, 95 % CI 1(.)3-2(.)3), panic attacks (OR 1(.)9, 95 % CI 1(.)3-2(.)8), and any anxiety disorder (OR 1(.)6, 95% CI 1(.)2-2(.)2). Associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders were adjusted for confounding factors using a fixed effects regression model which showed that, after control for fixed confounding factors, asthma was no longer significantly related to major depression (OR 1(.)1), panic attacks (OR 1(.)1),or any anxiety disorder (OR 1(.)2). Additional post hoe analyses suggested that exposure to childhood adversity or unexamined familial factors may account for some of the co-morbidity of asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders. Conclusions. These results confirm and extend previous findings by documenting elevated rates of depressive and anxiety disorders among young adults with asthma, compared with their counterparts without asthma, in the community. The weight of the evidence from this study suggests that associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety symptoms may reflect effects of common factors associated with both asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders, rather than a direct causal link. Future research is needed to identify the specific factors underlying these associations.

We attempted to clarify these points in a randomized open, controlled, two parallel group study in a real-life setting. Methods: Five hundred and eleven patients with allergic rhinitis with or without intermittent asthma were randomized to drugs only or drugs + SLIT (rate 2 : 3) for 3 years. The clinical score (symptoms + drug intake) was measured each year during the allergen exposure. Pulmonary function test, methacholine challenge and skin tests were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Adherence to treatment was assessed by measuring the consumed extract. Results: Three hundred and nineteen patients received SLIT and 192 drugs only. Dropouts were 15% in the SLIT group and 12% in the controls. There was a significant improvement of clinical scores in the SLIT group: baseline 147 +/- 3.3, first year 72.9 +/- 1.3, second year 68.3 +/- 1.8, third year 54.7 +/- 2.8 (P < 0.0001 vs baseline). Control group: baseline 138 +/- 2.3, first year 124.1 +/- 3.7, second year 111 +/- 3.3, third year 121 +/- 3.8 (P = NS). Only four patients reported systemic itching. Adherence was >80% in 72% and >60% in 18% of patients. The number of patients with a positive MCh challenge decreased significantly after 3 years only in the SLIT group. New skin sensitizations appeared in 38% of the controls and in 5.9% of the SLIT patients (P = 0.01). Conclusion: Sublingual immunotherapy approximately halved the clinical scores and significantly reduced the bronchial hyperreactivity. Similarly to subcutaneous immunotherapy, SLIT displayed a preventive effect on the onset of new skin sensitizations. The adherence rate was quantitatively satisfactory.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of enzymes capable of degrading the ECM. They are released along with their inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP). Study objectives: To determine whether severe, persistent asthma is associated with increased levels of MMP-9 in the airway compared with mild asthma, and to assess the effect of both allergen exposure and steroid treatment on MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels. Design: Prospective analysis of levels and activity of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in BAL fluid (BALF) and induced sputum obtained from asthmatics of differing disease severity. In patients with mild asthma, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were studied in induced sputum following allergen challenge and in BALF after inhaled steroid therapy. Patients: Eighteen patients with mild asthma, 10 patients with severe asthma, and 10 nonsmoking, atopic subjects had their sputum studied. Fourteen of the patients with mild asthma underwent allergen challenge. BAL was collected from 16 patients with mild asthma before and after 4 weeks treatment with inhaled budesonide, 800 mug bid, or placebo. Results: Patients with severe asthma had increased levels and activity of sputum MMP-9 in their sputum compared with patients with mild asthma and normal subjects. Allergen challenge increased the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio and MMP-9 activity. Inhaled budesonide had no effect on MMP-9 or TIMP-1 in patients with mild asthma. Conclusions: MMP-9 may play a role in chronic airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma, as concentrations are increased in severe, persistent asthma and following allergen challenge. Inhaled steroids may not affect MMP-9 and TIMP in patients with mild asthma, and additional studies in patients with more severe asthma are needed.

Specifically, we used exposures averaged over periods varying from 1 to 7 days to assess the effects of particulate matter on asthma hospitalization. We calculated estimates of the relative risk of asthma hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions (maximum and minimum temperatures, and average relative humidity) for an incremental exposure corresponding to the interquartile range in particulate matter. Both bidirectional case-crossover and time-series analyses revealed that coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5) averaged over 5-6 days was significantly associated with asthma hospitalization in both males and females. The magnitude of this effect appeared to increase with increasing number of days of exposure averaging for most models, with the relative risk estimates stabilizing at about 6 days. Using a bidirectional case-crossover analysis, the estimated relative risks were 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02, 1.28] for males and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02, 1.36) for females, for an increment of 8.4 mug/m(3) in 6-day averages of PM10-2.5. The corresponding relative risk estimates were 1.10 and 1.18, respectively, when we used time-series analysis. The effect Of PM10-2.5 remained positive after adjustment for the effects of the gaseous pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O-3). We did not find significant effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or of thoracic particulate matter (PM10) on asthma hospitalizations using either of these two analytic approaches. For the most part, relative risk estimates from the unidirectional case-crossover analysis were more pronounced compared with both bidirectional case-crossover and time-series analyses.

Several features of asthma pathophysiology can be initiated by exposure of the airway to acid. In renal tubular epithelium, glutaminase produces ammonia to buffer urinary acid excretion. We hypothesized that human airway epithelium could also express glutaminase. Here, we demonstrate that human airway epithelial cells in vitro have biochemical evidence for glutaminase activity and express mRNA for two glutaminase isoforms (KGA and GAC). Glutaminase activity increased in response to acidic stress (media PH 5.8) and was associated with both increased culture medium pH and improved cell survival. In contrast, activity was inhibited by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-a. Glutaminase protein was expressed in the human airway in vivo. Further, ammonia levels in the breath condensate of subjects with acute asthma were low (30 muM [range: 0-233], n = 18, age 23 +/- 2.5 yr) compared with control subjects (327 muM [14-1,220], n 24, age 24 +/- 2.4 yr, p < 0.001), and correlated with condensate pH (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). These data demonstrate that glutaminase is expressed and active in the human airway epithelium and may be relevant both to the regulation of airway pH and to the pathophysiology of acute asthmatic airway inflammation.

Although multiple factors are unquestionably involved in the EIB response, airway drying caused by a high exercise-ventilation rate is primary in most cases. The severity of this reaction reflects the allergic predisposition of the athlete, the water content of the inspired air, the type and concentration of air pollutants inspired, and the intensity (or ventilation rate) of the exercise. The highest prevalence of EIB is seen in winter-sport populations, where athletes are chronically exposed to cold dry air and/or environmental pollutants found in indoor ice arenas. When airway surface liquid lost during the natural warming and humidification process of respiration is not replenished at a rate equal to the loss, the ensuing osmolarity change stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators and results in bronchospasm; this cascade of events is exacerbated by airway inflammation and airway remodelling. The acute EIB response is characterised by airway smooth muscle contraction, membrane swelling, and/or mucus plug formation. Evidence suggests that histamine, leukotrienes and prostanoids are likely mediators for this response. Although the presence of symptoms and a basic physical examination are marginally effective, objective measures of lung function should be used for accurate and reliable diagnosis of EIB. Diagnosis should include baseline spirometry, followed by an appropriate bronchial provocation test. To date, the best test to confirm EIB may simply be standard pulmonary function testing before and after high-intensity dry air exercise. A 10% post-challenge fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second is used as diagnostic criteria. The goal of medical intervention is to limit EIB exacerbation and allow the athlete to train and compete symptom free. This is attempted through daily controller medications such as inhaled corticosteroids or by the prophylactic use of medications before exercise. In many cases, EIB is difficult to control. These and other data suggest that EIB in the elite athlete is in contrast with classic asthma.

Daily self-reports of asthma symp toms were obtained from study diaries and compared with ambient air pollution levels in marginal repeated measures logistic regression models. We defined days with asthma symptoms as any day a child reported at least one mild asthma episode. All analyses were controlled for subject-specific variables [age, race, sex, baseline height, and FEV1 PC20 concentration (methacholine provocative concentration required to produce a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec)] and potential rime-dependent confounders (day of week, season, and temperature). Because of variable observation periods for participants, we estimated both between- and within-subject air pollutant effects. Our primary interest was in the within-subject effects: the effect of air pollutant excursions from typical levels in each child's observation period on the odds of asthma symptoms. In single-pollutant models, the population average estimates indicated a 30% [95% confidence interval (CI), 11-52%] increase for a 1-ppm increment in carbon monoxide lagged I day, an 18% (95% CI, 5-33%) increase for a 10-mug/m(3) increment in same-day particulate matter < 1.0 <mu>m (PM1.0), and an 11% (95% CI, 3-20%) increase for a 10-mug/m(3) increment in particulate matter < 10 <mu>m (PM10) lagged 1 day. Conditional on the previous day's asthma symptoms, we estimated 25% (95% CI, 10-42%), 14% (95% CI, 4-26%), and 10% (95% CI, 3-16%) increases in the odds of asthma symptoms associated with increases in CO, PM1.0, and PM10, respectively. We did not find any association between sulfur dioxide (SO2) and the odds of asthma symptoms. In multipollutant models, the separate pollutant effects were smaller. The overall effect of an increase in both CO and PM1.0 was a 31% (95% CI, 11-55%) increase in the odds of symptoms of asthma. We conclude that there is an association between change in shea-term air pollution levels, as indexed by PM and CO, and the occurrence of asthma symptoms among children in Seattle. Although PM effects on asthma have been found in other studies, it is likely that CO is a marker for vehicle exhaust and other combustion by-products that aggravate asthma.

The airway narrowing is primarily caused by contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. The milder airway narrowing documented in response to exercise in elite athletes and otherwise healthy subjects may simply be the result of the physiologic responses and pathologic changes in airway cells arising from dehydration injury. These changes, which include excessive mucus production and airway edema, would serve both to cause cough and to amplify the narrowing effects of normal bronchial smooth muscle contraction, resulting in symptoms. These changes are more likely to occur in healthy subjects who exercise intensely for long periods of time breathing cold air, dry air, or both. Under these conditions, the ability to humidify inspired air may be overwhelmed, causing significant dehydration of the airway mucosa and an increase in osmolarity, even in small airways. In addition to dehydration injury, airway narrowing to pharmacologic and physical agents may occur as a result of injury caused by large volumes of air containing irritant gases, particulate matter, or allergens being inspired during exercise. As a result, the airways may become inflamed, and the airway smooth muscle may become more sensitive. These events could result in the same exaggerated airway response to dehydration, as documented in asthmatic subjects.

The mechanisms underlying chronicity in allergic inflammation remain unresolved. Periostin, a recently characterized matricellular protein, interacts with several cell surface integrin molecules, providing signals for tissue development and remodeling. Here we show that periostin is a critical mediator for the amplification and persistence of allergic inflammation using a mouse model of skin inflammation. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 stimulated fibroblasts to produce periostin, which interacted with alpha(v) integrin, a functional periostin receptor on keratinocytes, inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines, which consequently accelerated Th2-type immune responses. Accordingly, inhibition of periostin or alpha(v) integrin prevented the development or progression of allergen-induced skin inflammation. Thus, periostin sets up a vicious circle that links Th2-type immune responses to keratinocyte activation and plays a critical role in the amplification and chronicity of allergic skin inflammation.

Effects of climate change on environmental factors in respiratory allergic diseases	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review							RAGWEED AMBROSIA-ARTEMISIIFOLIA; PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; GRASS-POLLEN; DIESEL EXHAUST; HAY-FEVER; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; OZONE EXPOSURE; COMMON RAGWEED; PUBLIC-HEALTH	A body of evidence suggests that major changes involving the atmosphere and the climate, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere and the human environment. Studies on the effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and current knowledge is provided by epidemiological and experimental studies on the relationship between asthma and environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, airborne allergens and air pollution. However, there is also considerable evidence that subjects affected by asthma are at an increased risk of developing obstructive airway exacerbations with exposure to gaseous and particulate components of air pollution. It is not easy to evaluate the impact of climate change and air pollution on the prevalence of asthma in general and on the timing of asthma exacerbations. However, the global rise in asthma prevalence and severity suggests that air pollution and climate changes could be contributing. Pollen allergy is frequently used to study the interrelationship between air pollution, rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernized lifestyle are correlated to an increase in the frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy, prevalent in people who live in urban areas compared with those who live in rural areas. Meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.) along with their climatological regimes (warm or cold anomalies and dry or wet periods, etc.), can affect both biological and chemical components of this interaction. In addition, by inducing airway inflammation, air pollution overcomes the mucosal barrier priming allergen-induced responses. In conclusion, climate change might induce negative effects on respiratory allergic diseases. In particular, the increased length and severity of the pollen season, the higher occurrence of heavy precipitation events and the increasing frequency of urban air pollution episodes suggest that environmental risk factors will have a stronger effect in the following decades.

The therapeutic implications of these findings will be presented. Recent findings Mechanistically, the effect of oxidative stress on dendritic cells has been demonstrated to have a potent effect on Th1/Th2 skewing of the immune response. Investigations of gene-environment interactions have identified genetic polymorphisms associated with individual susceptibility to poll utant-ind uced respiratory oxidative stress. The effects of current asthma therapy on oxidative stress are currently unclear, but previous trials using conventional antioxidant therapy in asthma have been largely ineffective. Recent investigations have identified two promising broad-based therapeutic approaches: Nrf2 pathway activation and the use of thiol precursors. Preliminary data suggest that fullerene nanomaterials and dietary interventions may also have potential benefits in asthma. Summary Our current understanding of the role of oxidative stress in asthma suggests that antioxidant therapy may be important in optimizing asthma treatment and prevention. The future success of antioxidant asthma therapy will require strategies with broad effects on airway redox equilibrium and the selection of appropriate target populations.

Objective: To evaluate differences in the establishment of gut microbiota in infants born by vaginal or caesarean delivery and its impact on mucosal immunity. Methods: Altogether, 165 consecutive children, prospectively followed from birth at our clinic in Turku, Finland, were gathered; 141 (85%) were born by vaginal delivery and 24 (15%) by caesarean section. Blood was drawn at physician visits for indirect evaluation of mucosal immunity by ELISPOT assay. Faecal samples were obtained for determination of the gut microbiota by fluorescence in situ hybridization of bacterial cells. Results: Infants delivered by caesarean section harboured fewer bifidobacteria at an early age and were shown to mount a stronger humoral immune response. At 1 month of age, the total gut bacterial cell counts per 1 g faeces were higher in vaginally delivered infants (9.9 x 10(9), 95% CI 7.9 x 10(9)-1.2 x 10(10)) as compared to caesarean section delivered (3.1 x 10(9), 95% CI 1.1 x 10(9)-8.6 x 10(9)) (p = 0.001). This distinction was mainly due to the greater number of bifidobacteria in vaginally delivered infants (1.9 x 10(9), 95% CI 6.3 x 10(8)-5.6 x 10(9) vs. 1.5 x 10(6), 95% CI 4.1 x 10(2)-5.7 x 10(9), respectively) (p = 0.001). During the first year of life, the total number of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-secreting cells was lower (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, p = 0.11, respectively) in infants born by vaginal delivery than in those born by caesarean section, possibly reflecting excessive antigen exposure across the vulnerable gut barrier. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the mode of delivery may have, possibly via gut microbiota development, significant effects on immunological functions in the infant (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00167700).

Recent data suggest that severe asthma may be a different form of asthma rather than an increase in asthma symptoms and that innate immune responses to LPS can modulate adaptive immune responses to allergens. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that airway exposure to different doses of LPS induces different form of asthma. Our study showed that neutrophilic inflammation and IFN-gamma expression were higher in induced sputum from severe asthma patients than from mild to moderate asthmatics. Animal experiments indicated that allergen sensitization with low-dose LPS (0.1 mu g) induced type 2 asthma phenotypes, i.e., airway hyper-responsiveness, eosinophilic inflammation, and allergen-specific IgE up-regulation. In contrast, allergen sensitization with high-dose LPS (10 mu g) induced asthma phenotypes, i.e., airway hyperresponsiveness and noneosinophilic inflammation that were not developed in IFN-gamma-deficient mice, but unaffected in the absence of IL-4. During the allergen sensitization period, TNF-alpha expression was found to be enhanced by both low- and high-dose LPS, whereas IL-12 expression was only enhanced by high-dose LPS. Interestingly, the asthma phenotypes induced by low-dose LPS, but not by high-dose LPS, were completely inhibited in TNF-a receptor-deficient mice, whereas the asthma phenotypes induced by high-dose LPS were abolished in the homozygous null mutation of the STAT4 gene. These findings suggest that airway exposure levels of LPS induces different forms of asthma that are type 1 and type 2 asthma phenotypes by high and low LPS levels, respectively.

Uncertainties remain about the relative importance of smoking at different periods in the child's life. We investigate this in a pooled analysis, on 53 879 children from 12 cross-sectional studies-components of the PATY study (Pollution And The Young). Methods: Effects were estimated, within each study, of three exposures: mother smoked during pregnancy, parental smoking in the first two years, current parental smoking. Outcomes were: wheeze, asthma, "woken by wheeze'', bronchitis, nocturnal cough, morning cough, "sensitivity to inhaled allergens'' and hay fever. Logistic regressions were used, controlling for individual risk factors and study area. Heterogeneity between study-specific results, and mean effects (allowing for heterogeneity) were estimated using meta-analytical tools. Results: There was strong evidence linking parental smoking to wheeze, asthma, bronchitis and nocturnal cough, with mean odds ratios all around 1.15, with independent effects of prenatal and postnatal exposures for most associations. Conclusions: Adverse effects of both pre- and postnatal parental smoking on children's respiratory health were confirmed. Asthma was most strongly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, but postnatal exposure showed independent associations with a range of other respiratory symptoms. All tobacco smoke exposure has serious consequences for children's respiratory health and needs to be reduced urgently.

In this regard an inverse correlation between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and development of childhood allergy has been found. Objective To assess the impact of prenatal LPS exposure on the development of postnatal respiratory allergies in a mouse model of experimental asthma. Methods Female BALB/c mice were exposed to LPS before conception and during pregnancy. Several weeks after birth offspring were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by aerosol allergen challenges. Results Prenatal, maternal LPS-exposure enhanced neonatal IFN-gamma, but not IL-4 and IL-2 production. OVA sensitization of prenatally LPS-exposed mice was accompanied by a marked suppression in anti-OVA IgG1 and IgE as well as unchanged IgG2a antibody responses, paralleled by a significant reduction in IL-5 and IL-13 levels following mitogenic stimulation of splenic leucocytes. Assessment of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids following allergen challenges revealed a marked reduction in eosinophils and macrophages in these mice. Surprisingly, development of airway hyper-responsiveness, a hallmark of bronchial asthma, was not affected. Conclusion This study provides first experimental evidence that LPS may already operate in prenatal life in order to modulate the development of allergies in the offspring.

This could be explained by the hygiene hypothesis, which states that exposure to specific infections or endotoxins during infancy drives the maturing immune system towards a Th1 phenotype and away from the Th2 phenotype, which is associated with allergic diseases. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in the signalling of many pathogen-related molecules and endogenous proteins associated with immune activation. Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in genes encoding TLRs are associated with asthma or total serum IgE levels. Methods We screened the 5' flanking and coding regions of the TLR2,TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 genes for polymorphisms by direct sequencing of DNA from 32 asthmatics, and analysed the effect of the polymorphisms on the development of atopic asthma and on total serum IgE levels. Results We identified 16 variants in TLRs. The transmission disequilibrium test of the families revealed that none of the alleles or haplotypes were associated with asthma or total IgE levels (P>0.05). However, we found an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of TLR2, and an expression construct containing the deletion allele showed lower luciferase activity than the wild-type alleles, suggesting that the deletion allele has reduced transcriptional activity. Conclusion Our results indicate that polymorphisms in TLRs are not likely to be associated with the development of atopy-related phenotypes in a Japanese population.

Design and setting: Case- control study conducted in five French metropolitan areas between 1998 and 2000. A set of 217 pairs of matched 4 to 14 years old cases and controls were investigated. An index of lifelong exposure to traffic exhausts was constructed, using retrospective information on traffic density close to all home and school addresses since birth; this index was also calculated for the 0 - 3 years age period to investigate the effect of early exposures. Main results: Adjusted on environmental tobacco smoke, personal and parental allergy, and several confounders, lifelong exposure was not associated with asthma. In contrast, associations before age of 3 were significant: odds ratios for tertiles 2 and 3 of the exposure index, relative to tertile 1, exhibited a positive trend ( 1.48 ( 95% CI = 0.7 to 3.0) and 2.28 ( 1.1 to 4.6)), with greater odds ratios among subjects with positive skin prick tests. Conclusions: These results suggest that traffic related pollutants might have contributed to the asthma epidemic that has taken place during the past decades among children.

Recently, polymorphisms in caspase recruitment domain containing protein 15 (CARD15), an intracellular LPS receptor protein, have been associated with Crohn's disease. Because these polymorphisms lead to changes in LPS recognition, they may affect the development of asthma and allergies. Objective: We genotyped a large population of German schoolchildren (N = 1872) from East and West Germany for 3 functional relevant CARD15 polymorphisms for their role in the development of asthma and allergy. Methods: By use of parental questionnaires, skin prick testing, pulmonary function tests, bronchial challenge tests, and measurements of serum IgE levels, children were phenotyped for the presence of atopic diseases. Genotyping was performed with PCR-based restriction enzyme assays. To assess associations between atopic phenotypes and genotypes standard statistical procedures were applied. Results: Children with the polymorphic allele C2722 had a more than 3-fold risk to develop allergic rhinitis (P < .001) and an almost 2-fold risk for atopic dermatitis (P < .05). Furthermore, the T2104 allele was associated with an almost 2-fold risk for allergic rhinitis (P < .05). When a C insertion at position 3020 was present, the risk of atopy increased by 50% (P < .05) and serum IgE levels were elevated (P < .01). Conclusion: The shared genetic background between Crohn's disease and atopy may indicate that an impaired recognition of microbial exposures results in an insufficient downregulation of excessive immune responses, giving rise to either T(H)2 dominated allergies or T(H)1 related Crohn's disease.

Allergic patients produce specific IgE antibodies after frequent exposure to either inhaled or nutritive allergens. Of the plant allergens listed in the Official Allergen Database of the International Union of Immunological Societies, approx. 25 % belong to the group of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-proteins). PR-proteins are defined as proteins that are induced upon stress, pathogen attack and abiotic stimuli. This inhomogeneous group of proteins has been classified into 14 PR-protein families. So far, plant-derived allergens have been identified with sequence similarities to PR-protein families 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 14. In general, both protein groups, i.e. PR-proteins and allergens, comprise rather small proteins, which are stable at low pH and resistant to proteolysis. These features, and their level of expression, make PR-proteins good candidates for evoking an immune response in predisposed humans, when coming into contact with mucosal surfaces. The identification of PR-proteins with allergenic potential and their homologues is of importance for the allergic patient and the management of this disease. Firstly, plant foods derived from genetically modified plants could represent new allergen sources, and therefore should be evaluated carefully for their potential allergenicity.

Working in animal housings can be associated with exposure to organic dust, bacteria, moulds, endotoxin, and ammonia in concentrations that can induce cellular and immunological responses and result in respiratory diseases. Working in poultry housing might be associated with higher exposures to dust, bacteria, and ammonia than in swine and cow housings, and endotoxin exposure seems to be higher in North America than in Europe. Working exposure might influence the domestic area on farms, and there might be a protective effect of being raised on a farm regarding sensitisation and allergic diseases. Sensitisation to mites seems to be the most prevalent of the common inhalant allergens. Chronic bronchitis is frequent and data suggests that it is work related in farmers. Findings concerning asthma are less uniform, and data regarding bronchial hyperresponsiveness are too sparse and inconsistent to evaluate the effect on farming. Several risk factors have been described, and age is shared for all three clinical manifestations, while male gender, atopy, smoking, pig farming, and animal production are common risk factors for chronic bronchitis and asthma. FEV1, and FEV1/FVC seems to be reduced in farmers, and longitudinal studies indicate an increased annual loss in FEV1 in farmers, especially in pig farmers. The increased annual decline has been associated with lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, smoking, automatic dry feeding systems, and endotoxin. Despite studies with methodological weaknesses, heterogenity in sampling times, measurement techniques, equipment, and diagnostic criteria, the review has revealed that the exposure to organic dust in farming can be substantial and might lead to respiratory diseases and increased annual loss in lung function. Working exposure seems to influence the domestic area in farms, and being raised on a farm might have a protective effect regarding sensitisation and allergic diseases.

Recent guidelines for asthma management recommend reducing exposure to relevant allergens, but neither the feasibility nor the efficacy of this form of treatment has been established for children living in poverty. Objective: We sought to investigate allergen avoidance as a treatment for asthma among inner-city children. Methods: One hundred four children with asthma living in the city of Atlanta were enrolled into a controlled trial of avoidance without being skin tested. The children were randomized to an active avoidance group, a placebo avoidance group, and a second control group for which no house visits occurred until the end of the first year. Avoidance included bed and pillow covers, hot washing of bedding, and cockroach bait. Eighty-five children completed the study, and the outcome was measured as unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalization for asthma, as well as changes in mite and cockroach allergen levels. Results: There was a significant decrease in acute visits for asthma among children whose homes were visited (P <.001). However, there was no significant difference between the active and placebo homes either in the effect on asthma visits or in allergen concentrations. When the children with mite allergy were considered separately, there was a significant correlation between decreased mite allergen and change in acute visits (P <.01). The avoidance measures for cockroach allergen appeared to be ineffective, and the changes observed did not correlate with changes in visits. Conclusions: Applying allergen avoidance as a treatment for asthma among children living in poverty is difficult because of multiple sensitivities and problems applying the protocols in this environment. The current results demonstrate that home visiting positively influences the management of asthma among families living in poverty. Furthermore, the results for children with mite allergy strongly suggest that decreasing relevant allergen exposure should be an objective of treatment in this population.

We measured endotoxin in family-room air and in dust from the baby's bed, family room, bedroom, and kitchen floor. Level of airborne endotoxin was weakly correlated (r < 0.3) with level of endotoxin in each of the four types of dust samples and was significantly correlated with endotoxin in family-room dust (p < 0.05). Endotoxin in family-room dust accounted for < 6% of the variability of airborne endotoxin. In a multivariate model, certain home characteristics were positively (p < 0.05) associated with airborne endotoxin. These included current presence of dog (difference in level, dog vs. no dog = 72%, partial R-2 = 12.8%), past presence of dog (partial R-2 = 5.5%), and endotoxin level in family-room dust (partial R-2 = 5.3%). Use of a dehumidifier (partial R-2 = 6.4%) was negatively associated (p = 0.02; difference = -31%) with airborne endotoxin. Other home characteristics were identified as important determinants of increased airborne endotoxin in this model, but individual coefficients were not statistically significant (alpha = 0.05): total amount of fine dust collected in the home (partial R-2 = 3.8%), concrete floor in family room (3.7%), water damage (3.6%), and use of cool-mist humidifier in past year (2.7%). This multivariate model explained 42% of the variability of airborne endotoxin levels, a substantial improvement over that with dust endotoxin alone. Airborne endotoxin in Boston-area homes appears to be determined by the presence of dogs, moisture sources, and increased a-mounts of settled dust.

Toll/IL-1 Signaling Is Critical for House Dust Mite-specific Th1 and Th2 Responses	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						asthma; innate immunity; eosinophil; neutrophil	ALLERGIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; DENDRITIC CELLS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS; INHALED ANTIGEN; CUTTING EDGE; OX40 LIGAND	Rationale: One of the immunopathological features of allergic inflammation is the infiltrationof helper T type 2 (Th2) cells to the site of disease. Activation of innate pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) plays a critical role in helper T type I cell differentiation, yet their contribution to the generation of Th2 responses to clinically relevant aeroallergens remains poorly defined. Objectives: To determine the requirement for TLR2, TLR4, and the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain adaptor protein MyD88 in a murine model of allergic asthma. Methods: Wild-type and factor-deficient ((-/-)) mice were sensitized intranasally to the common allergen house dust mite (HDM) and challenged 2 weeks later on four consecutive days. Measurements of allergic airway inflammation, T-cell cytokine production, and airway hyperreactivity, were performed 24 hours later. Measurements and Main Results: Mice deficient in MyD88 were protected from the cardinal features of allergic asthma, including granulocytic inflammation, Th2 cytokine production and airway hyperreactivity. Although HDM activated NF-kappa B in TLR2- or TLR4-expressing HEK cells, only in TLR4(-/-) mice was the magnitude of allergic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity attenuated. The diminished Th2 response present in MyD88(-/-) and TLR4(-/-) mice was associated with fewer OX40 ligand-expressing myeloid dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes during allergic sensitization. Finally, HDM-specific IL-17 production and airway neutrophilia were attenuated in MyD88(-/-) but not TLR4(-/-) mice. Conclusions: Together, these data suggest that Th2- and Th17-mediated inflammation generated on inhalational HDM exposure is differentially regulated by the presence of microbial products and the activation of distinct MyD88-dependent pattern recognition receptors.

Loss-of-function mutations in the profilaggrin gene (FLG) are common and are present in up to 10% of the population. These mutations are the cause of the semi-dominant skin-scaling disorder ichthyosis vulgaris and are a major risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis. The discovery of these mutations also provides new data concerning the genetics of atopic asthma as well as intriguing insight into disease mechanisms of systemic allergies involving antigen exposure in skin with defective barrier function. Collectively, these novel findings have significant implications for the classification and future clinical management of patients with atopic and allergic diseases.

We examined changes in asthma morbidity in children as a result of home remediation aimed at moisture sources. DESIGN: In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, symptomatic, asthmatic children (n = 62), 2-17 years of age, living in a home with indoor mold, received an asthma intervention including an action plan, education, and individualized problem solving. The remediation group also received household repairs, including reduction of water infiltration, removal of water-damaged building materials, and heating/ventilation/air-conditioning alterations. The control group received only home cleaning information. We measured children's total and allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, and urinary cotinine. Environmental dust samples were analyzed for dust mite, cockroach, rodent urinary protein, endotoxin, and fungi. The follow-up period was 1 year. RESULTS: Children in both groups showed improvement in asthma symptomatic days during the preremediation portion of the study. The remediation group had a significant decrease in symptom days (p = 0.003, as randomized; p = 0.004, intent to treat) after remodeling, whereas these parameters in the control group did not significantly change. In the postremediation period, the remediation group had a lower rate of exacerbations compared with control asthmatics (as treated: 1 of 29 vs. 11 of 33, respectively, p = 0.003; intent to treat: 28.1% and 10.0%, respectively, p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Construction remediation aimed at the root cause of moisture sources and combined with a medical/behavioral intervention significantly reduces symptom days and health care use for asthmatic children who live in homes with a documented mold problem.

Exposure to Alternaria alternata in US homes is associated with asthma symptoms	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						alternaria alternata; fungal allergen; antigen; indoor; exposure; asthma; allergy	NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY; FUNGAL ALLERGENS; INDOOR ALLERGENS; NATIONAL-HEALTH; AIRBORNE FUNGI; RISK-FACTOR; CHILDREN; OUTDOOR; SPORES; RHINITIS	Background: Exposure to the fungus Alternaria alternata is a risk factor for asthma. Few studies have examined Alternaria exposures in indoor environments. Objective: We examined whether exposure to A alternata in US homes was associated with asthma-related outcomes. Methods: The data for this study were collected as part of the National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing. This cross-sectional study surveyed a nationally representative sample of 831 housing units inhabited by 2456 individuals in 75 different locations throughout the United States. An interviewer-administered questionnaire obtained information on demographics, household characteristics, and occupants' health status. Exposure to A alternata was assessed by measuring concentrations of A alternata antigens in vacuumed dust samples using a polyclonal anti-A alternata antibody assay. Dust samples were collected from a bed, a sofa, or a chair, and from bedroom, living room, and kitchen floors. Results: Lifetime prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma was 11.2%, and 6.9% of the study subjects reported active asthma symptoms in the past 12 months. The prevalence of current symptomatic asthma increased with increasing Alternaria concentrations in US homes; higher levels of A alternata antigens increased the odds of having asthma symptoms in the past year (relative to the lowest tertile, adjusted odds ratio was 1.52, 95% CI, 0.90-2.55 for the 2nd tertile; and 1.84, 95% Cl, 1.18-2.85 for the 3rd tertile). Conclusion: Exposure to A alternata in US homes is associated with active asthma symptoms. Clinical implications: Measures that reduce indoor exposure to A alternata may help control asthma exacerbations.

Nevertheless, the occurrence of peanut allergy varies between countries and depends on both the exposure and the way peanuts are consumed. Processing is known to influence the allergenicity of peanut proteins. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of thermal processing on the IgE-binding capacity of whole peanut protein extracts and of the major peanut allergens Ara h 1 and Ara h 2. Whole proteins, Ara h 1, and Ara h 2 were extracted and purified from raw, roasted and boiled peanuts using selective precipitation and multiple chromatographic steps, and were then characterized by electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The immunoreactivity of whole peanut extracts and purified proteins was analyzed by the enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) and EAST inhibition using the sera of 37 peanut-allergic patients. The composition of the whole protein extracts was modified after heat processing, especially after boiling. The electrophoretic pattern showed protein bands of low molecular weight that were less marked in boiled than in raw and roasted peanuts. The same low-molecular-weight proteins were found in the cooking water of peanuts. Whole peanut protein extracts obtained after the different processes were all recognized by the IgE of the 37 patients. The IgE-binding capacity of the whole peanut protein extracts prepared from boiled peanuts was 2-fold lower than that of the extracts prepared from raw and roasted peanuts. No significant difference was observed between protein extracts from raw and roasted peanuts. It is noteworthy that the proteins present in the cooking water were also recognized by the IgE of peanut-allergic patients. IgE immunoreactivity of purified Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 prepared from roasted peanuts was higher than that of their counterparts prepared from raw and boiled peanuts. The IgE-binding capacity of purified Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 was altered by heat treatment and in particular was increased by roasting. However, no significant difference in IgE immunoreactivity was observed between whole protein extracts from raw and roasted peanuts. The decrease in allergenicity of boiled peanuts results mainly from a transfer of low-molecular-weight allergens into the water during cooking.

Aims: To explore whether late introduction of solids is protective against the development of asthma, eczema, and atopy. Methods: A total of 642 children were recruited before birth and followed to the age of 5 1/2 years. Main outcome measures were: doctor's diagnosis of eczema ever, atopy according to skin prick test results against inhalant allergens, preschool wheezing, transient wheezing, all defined at age 5 - 5 1/2 years. Introduction of solids as main exposure measure was assessed retrospectively at age 1 year. Results: There was no evidence for a protective effect of late introduction of solids for the development of preschool wheezing, transient wheezing, atopy, or eczema. On the contrary, there was a statistically significant increased risk of eczema in relation to late introduction of egg (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4) and milk (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5). Late introduction of egg was furthermore associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of preschool wheezing (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.4). There was no statistical evidence of feeding practices playing a different role in the development of asthma and eczema after stratification for parental asthma and atopy status.

Pollen allergens found in small, respirable particles have been implicated in a number of asthma epidemics, particularly ones following rainfall or thunderstorms. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how pollen allergens form the respirable aerosols necessary for triggering asthma. Methods: Flowering grasses were humidified and then dried in a controlled-environment chamber connected to a cascade impactor and an aerosol particle counter. Particles shed from the flowers were analyzed with high-resolution microscopy and immunolabeled with rabbit anti-Phl p 1 antibody, which is specific for group 1 pollen allergens. Results: Contrary to what has been reported in other published accounts, most of the pollen in this investigation remained on the open anthers of wind pollinated plants unless disturbed-eg, by wind. Increasing humidity caused anthers to close. After a cycle of wetting and drying followed by wind disturbance, grasses flowering within a chamber produced an aerosol of particles that were collected in a cascade impactor. These particles consisted of fragmented pollen cytoplasm in the size range 0.12 to 4.67 mum; they were loaded with group I allergens. Conclusion: Here we provide the first direct observations of the release of grass pollen allergens as respirable aerosols. They can emanate directly from the flower after a moisture-drying cycle. This could explain asthmatic responses associated with grass pollination, particularly after moist weather conditions.

Thus quantitative immunoassays for IgE antibodies may be an adjunct to skin tests. In cases of food allergy among children with atopic dermatitis, cutoff values for IgE antibody concentrations to egg, milk, peanut, and fish have been derived to provide 95% positive and 90% negative predictive values. Food-specific IgE antibody determinations can also be used to predict which food allergies are resolving spontaneously. Elevated egg-specific IgE antibody levels in infancy are associated with significantly increased risk for development of inhalant allergies later in childhood. In cases of inhalant allergy, specific IgE antibody levels correlate closely with results of inhalation challenge studies in cat-sensitive persons. Also, mite-specific IgE antibody levels correlate significantly with the mite allergen contents of reservoir dust in the homes of mite-sensitive persons. Immunoassays for quantitation of specific IgE antibodies may be used to document allergen sensitization over time and to evaluate the risk of reaction on allergen exposure. However, immunoassays and skin tests are not entirely interchangeable, and neither will replace the other in appropriate circumstances.

The safety of this treatment, particularly when administered without direct medical surveillance, as in the case of the sublingual-swallow route needs to be established. The aim of this paper is to review the safety of the sublingual-swallow immunotherapy as reported in eight double-blind, placebo-controlled trials carried out in France, Italy and Greece. Methods: Six hundred and ninety subjects, 472 adults and 218 children, took part in trials of specific immunotherapy (SIT) for the treatment of rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Three hundred and forty-seven patients received SIT and 343 patients received placebo. Treatment with specific immunotherapy with allergen extracts or placebo was administered using the sublingual-swallow technique. The allergens administered were grass, ambrosia, parietaria and olive pollens, and mites. The daily dose taken during maintenance therapy ranged from 100 to 300 IR (index of reactivity) and cumulative doses ranged from 4,500 to 104,000 IR. Treatment duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. Adverse events reported either spontaneously by the patient or on direct questioning by the investigator were analysed. Results: One hundred and forty-five unusual events were reported in the subjects receiving active SIT and 79 in those receiving placebo (p < 0.001). Of these 85 were children aged 15 years or less (50 received active SIT, 35 placebo) and 139 were adults (95 received SIT, 44 placebo). Unusual events involving the buccal cavity (61 SIT, 13 placebo) and the gastro-intestinal tract (47 SIT, 15 placebo) were significantly more frequent in the SIT-treated patients (p < 0.001). Wheezing (9 SIT, 21 placebo) was more frequent in the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the frequency of unusual events between adults and children and in the frequency of events involving other body systems. No event was reported as serious. Two events reported as laryngeal oedema were not considered to be accurate descriptions. Conclusions: No serious adverse event was reported in the studies monitored, confirming the good safety profile of the sublingual-swallow method both in children and adults with rhinitis or moderate asthma.

The AAAAI and the ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing "Atopic dermatitis: a practice parameter update 2012.'' This is a complete and comprehensive document at the current time. The medical environment is a changing environment, and not all recommendations will be appropriate for all patients. Because this document incorporated the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including those who served on the Joint Task Force, is authorized to provide an official AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information about or an interpretation of these practice parameters by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the Executive Offices of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. Published practice parameters of the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy & Immunology are available online at http://www.jcaai.org. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013;131:295-9.)

Basic science and epidemiologic research suggest that oxidative stress and inflammation may play a role in disease development. Traffic-related air pollution, a common exposure with established effects on these pathways, contains substances found to have adverse prenatal effects. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between autism and proximity of residence to freeways and major roadways during pregnancy and near the time of delivery, as a surrogate for air pollution exposure. METHODS: Data were from 304 autism cases and 259 typically developing controls enrolled in the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study. The mother's address recorded on the birth certificate and trimester-specific addresses derived from a residential history obtained by questionnaire were geocoded, and measures of distance to freeways and major roads were calculated using ArcGIS software. Logistic regression models compared residential proximity to freeways and major roads for autism cases and typically developing controls. RESULTS: Adjusting for sociodemographic factors and maternal smoking, maternal residence at the time of delivery was more likely be near a freeway (<= 309 m) for cases than for controls [odds ratio (OR) = 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.45]. Autism was also associated with residential proximity to a freeway during the third trimester (OR = 2.22; CI, 1.16-4.42). After adjustment for socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics, these associations were unchanged. Living near other major roads at birth was not associated with autism. CONCLUSIONS: Living near a freeway was associated with autism. Examination of associations with measured air pollutants is needed.

A Comprehensive Identification of Disinfection By-products and Assessment of Mutagenicity of Chlorinated and Brominated Swimming Pool Water	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						bromination; bromine; chlorination; chlorine; DBPs; disinfection by-products; mutagenicity; swimming pools; Salmonella; water	GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; DRINKING-WATER; TRIHALOMETHANE CONCENTRATIONS; SALMONELLA MUTAGENICITY; EXPOSURE; GENOTOXICITY; BROMODICHLOROMETHANE; CHLORAMINES; CHLOROFORM; EXPRESSION	BACKGROUND: Swimming pool disinfectants and disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been linked to human health effects, including asthma and bladder cancer, but no studies have provided a comprehensive identification of DBPs in the water and related that to mutagenicity. OBJECTIVES: We performed a comprehensive identification of DBPs and disinfectant species in waters from public swimming pools in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that disinfect with either chlorine or bromine and we determined the mutagenicity of the waters to compare with the analytical results. METHODS: We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure trihalomethanes in water, GC with electron capture detection for air, low- and high-resolution GC/MS to comprehensively identify DBPs, photometry to measure disinfectant species (free chlorine, monochloroamine, dichloramine, and trichloramine) in the waters, and an ion chromatography method to measure trichloramine in air. We assessed mutagenicity with the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. RESULTS: We identified > 100 DBPs, including many nitrogen-containing DBPs that were likely formed from nitrogen-containing precursors from human inputs, such as urine, sweat, and skin cells. Many DBPs were new and have not been reported previously in either swimming pool or drinking waters. Bromoform levels were greater in brominated than in chlorinated pool waters, but we also identified many brominated DBPs in the chlorinated waters. The pool waters were mutagenic at levels similar to that of drinking water (similar to 1,200 revertants/L-equivalents in strain TA100-S9 mix). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified many new DBPs not identified previously in swimming pool or drinking water and found that swimming pool waters are as mutagenic as typical drinking waters.

DATA EXTRACTION: After a systematic literature review, we extracted quantitative estimates of the association of PM10 and/or NO2 with respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Combined effect estimates for an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) were calculated by random effects meta-analysis for all studies and for different strata defined by study characteristics. The effect of publication bias was investigated with Egger's and Begg's tests and "trim-and-fill" analyses. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 36 studies; 14 were part of the European Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) study. Adverse associations of PM10 with asthma symptoms were statistically significant [odds ratio (OR) = 1.028; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.006-1.051]. There were also associations, although not statistically significant, of PM10 with cough (OR = 1.012; 95% CI, 0.997-1.026) and on PEF (decrease of-0.082 L/min; 95% CI, -0.214 to 0.050). NO2 had statistically significant associations with asthma symptoms in the overall analysis considering all possible lags (OR = 1.031; 95% CI, 1.001-1.062), but not when we evaluated only the 0-1 lag. We found no publication bias, although it appeared when excluding the PEACE studies. When we applied the trim-and-fill method to the data set without the PEACE studies, the results were similar to the overall estimates from all studies. There was an indication for stronger PM10 associations for studies conducted in summer, outside of Europe, with longer lags, and in locations with higher NO2 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We found clear evidence of effects of PM10 on the occurrence of asthma symptom episodes, and to a lesser extent on cough and PEF. The results for NO2 are more difficult to interpret because they depend on the lag times examined. There was an indication of effect modification by several study conditions.

The adult gut mucosa contains some 80% of the body's activated B cells-differentiated to plasmablasts and plasma cells (PCs). Most mucosal PCs produce dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA), which, along with pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM), can be exported by secretory epithelia expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. Immune exclusion of antigens is performed mainly by secretory IgA in cooperation with innate defenses, but, in newborns and in IgA deficiency, secretory IgM is important. In the gut, induction and regulation of mucosal immunity occurs primarily in gut-associated lymphoid tissue-particularly the Peyer's patches-and also in mesenteric lymph nodes. Terminal differentiation to PCs is accomplished in the lamina propria to which the activated memory/effector T and B cells home. Lactating mammary glands are part of the secretory immune system, and IgA antibodies in breast milk reflect antigenic stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue such as the tonsils. Breast-milk antibodies are thus highly targeted against infectious agents and other exogenous antigens in the mother's environment, which are those likely to be encountered by the infant. Therefore breast-feeding represents an ingenious immunologic integration of mother and child. (J Pediatr 2010;156:S8-15).

The Identification of novel genes for asthma suggests that many genes with small effect,; rather than few genes with strong effects contribute to the development of asthma. These genetic effects may in part differ with respect to a subject's environmental exposures, although some genes may also exert their effect independently of the environment. Whereas the geneticist uses highly advanced, rapid, comprehensive technologies to assess even subtle changes in the human genome, the researcher interested in environmental exposures is often confronted with crude information obtained from questionnaires or interviews. There is thus substantial need to develop better tools for individual exposure assessment in all relevant environmental fields. Despite these limitations, a number of important gene-environment interactions have been identified. These interactions point to the biology of environmental exposures as the involved genetic variation is suggestive of certain underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the identification of subjects who are particularly susceptible to environmental hazards through genetic analyses helps to estimate better the strength of effect of environmental exposures. Finally, the analysis of gene-environment interactions may result in a reconciliation of seemingly contradictory findings from studies not taking environmental exposures into account.

Total and allergen-specific IgE concentrations, IgE affinity for allergen, and IgE clonality are all distinct properties of allergic patients' IgE repertoires. However, the inability to isolate individual IgE antibodies from allergic patients' sera presents a major barrier to understanding the importance of patient-specific IgE repertoires for the manifestation and severity of allergic symptoms. Objective: We sought to investigate how individual properties of an IgE repertoire affect effector cell degranulation. Methods: A panel of recombinant IgE (rIgE) antibodies specific for the major house dust mite allergen Der p 2 was developed and characterized in regard to Der p 2 affinity, as well as Der p 2 epitope specificity, by using surface plasmon resonance technology. Human basophils were sensitized with different combinations of rIgEs, and degranulation responses were measured by means of flow cytometry after challenge with Der p 2. Results: A total of 31 Der p 2-specific rIgEs were produced. They bound a total of 9 different Der p 2 epitopes in the affinity range (KD value) of 0.0358 to 291 nM. Factors increasing human basophil degranulation were increased total IgE concentrations, increased concentrations of allergen-specific IgE relative to non-allergen-specific IgE, more even concentration of individual allergen-specific IgE clones, increased IgE affinity for allergen, and increased number of allergen epitopes recognized by the IgE repertoire (increased IgE clonality). Conclusion: This study demonstrates how distinct properties of the IgE repertoire, such as total and allergen-specific IgE antibody concentration, IgE affinity, and IgE clonality, affect effector cell degranulation.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical and preventive effects of SLIT in children by assessing onset of persistent asthma and new sensitizations, clinical symptoms, and bronchial hyperreactivity. Methods: A total of 216 children with allergic rhinitis, with or without intermittent asthma, were evaluated and then randomized to receive drugs alone or drugs plus SLIT openly for 3 years. The clinical score was assessed yearly during allergen exposure. Pulmonary function testing, methacholine challenge, and skin prick testing were performed at the beginning and end of the study. Results: One hundred forty-four children received SLIT and 72 received drugs only. Dropouts were 9.7% in the SLIT group and 8.3% in the controls. New sensitizations appeared in 34.8% of controls and in 3.1% of SLIT patients (odds ratio, 16.85; 95% confidence interval, 5.73-49.13). Mild persistent asthma was less frequent in SLIT patients (odds ratio, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.17). There was a significant decrease in clinical scores in the SLIT group vs the control group since the first year. The number of children with a positive methacholine challenge result decreased significantly after 3 years only in the SLIT group. Adherence was 80% or higher in 73.8% of patients. Only 1 patient reported systemic itching. Conclusions: In everyday clinical practice, SLIT reduced the onset of new sensitizations and mild persistent asthma and decreased bronchial hyperreactivity in children with respiratory allergy.

Objectives: To investigate the risk of new-onset asthma in relation to the use of common household cleaners. Methods: Within the follow-up of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey in 10 countries, we identified 3,503 persons doing the cleaning in their homes and who were free of asthma at baseline. Frequency of use of 15 types of cleaning products was obtained in a face-to-face interview at follow-up. We studied the incidence of asthma defined as physician diagnosis and as symptoms or medication usage at follow-up. Associations between asthma and the use of cleaning products were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards or log-binomial regression analysis. Measurements and Main Results: The use of cleaning sprays at least weekly (42 70 of participants) was associated with the incidence of asthma symptoms or medication (relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95070 confidence interval [Cl], 1.12-1.99) and wheeze (RR, 1.39; 95 % Cl, 1.06-1.80). The incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma was higher among those using sprays at least 4 days per week (RR, 2.11; 95% Cl, 1.15-3.89). These associations were consistent for subgroups and not modified by atopy. Dose-response relationships (P < 0.05) were apparent for the frequency of use and the number of different sprays. Risks were predominantly found for the commonly used glass-cleaning, furniture, and air-refreshing sprays. Cleaning products not applied in spray form were not associated with asthma. Conclusions: Frequent use of common household cleaning sprays may be an important risk factor for adult asthma.

The aim of this study was to establish reference values of FENO for adults. Methods: FENO at a flow rate of 50 mL/s was analyzed in 3,376 adults using a chemiluminescence analyzer according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines. Blood samples were analyzed, and atopy was defined as the presence of specific IgE. All subjects responded to a respiratory questionnaire. Those who had never smoked (n = 1,803) were selected for this study. After the exclusion of subjects with physician-diagnosed asthma, asthma symptoms, ever wheezing, dry cough, or use of inhaled steroids, 1,131 healthy never-smokers remained, including 845 nonatopic and 286 atopic subjects. Results: Based on multiple regression modeling, we propose the following reference equation for healthy never-smoking adults: Ln(FENO) = 0.057 + 0.013 x height (in centimeters) + 0.0088 x age (in years). The residual SD was 0.51, and the explanatory value was 9%. In a model, based on nonatopic subjects alone, the reference equation obtained was slightly different, as follows: Ln(FENO) = -0.0026 + 0.013 x height (in centimeters) + 0.010 x age (in years). The residual SD for this equation was 0.48, and the explanatory value was 11%. Conclusions: Normal values of FENO for adults may be predicted on the basis of age and height. However, as the reference equations only account for about 9 to 11% of the variation, the most important information that could be extracted from the study is that the upper limits of FENO range from 24.0 to 54.0 parts per billion, depending on age and height.

Accelerated antigen sampling and transport by airway mucosal dendritic cells following inhalation of a bacterial stimulus	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							INHALED ANTIGEN; LYMPH-NODES; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; INHIBITION; INDUCTION; TOLERANCE; ASTHMA; PHASE; MICE	An increase in the tempo of local dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune surveillance is a recognized feature of the response to acute inflammation at airway mucosal surfaces, and transient up-regulation of the APC functions of these DC preceding their emigration to regional lymph nodes has recently been identified as an important trigger for T cell-mediated airway tissue damage in diseases such as asthma. In this study, using a rat model, we demonstrate that the kinetics of the airway mucosal DC (AMDC) response to challenge with heat-killed bacteria is considerably more rapid and as a consequence more effectively compartmentalized than that in recall responses to soluble Ag. Notably, Ag-bearing AMDC expressing full APC activity reach regional lymph nodes within 30 min of cessation of microbial exposure, and in contrast to recall responses to nonpathogenic Ags, there is no evidence of local expression of APC activity within the airway mucosa preceding DC emigration. We additionally demonstrate that, analogous to that reported in the gut, a subset of airway intraepithelial DC extend their processes into the airway lumen. This function is constitutively expressed within the AMDC population, providing a mechanism for continuous immune surveillance of the airway luminal surface in the absence of "danger", signals.

Using the carbon content of airway macrophages as a marker of individual exposure to particulate matter derived from fossil fuel, we sought direct evidence of this association. Methods Airway macrophages were obtained from healthy children through sputum induction, and the area of airway macrophages occupied by carbon was measured. Lung function was measured with the use of spirometry. We modeled the exposure to primary particulate matter ( PM) that is less than 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) at or near each child's home address. Linear regression was used to evaluate associations between carbon content of alveolar macrophages and variables that may affect individual exposure. To determine whether lung function that is reduced for other reasons is associated with an increase in the carbon content of airway macrophages, we also studied children with severe asthma. Results We were able to assess the carbon content of airway macrophages in 64 of 114 healthy children (56 percent). Each increase in primary PM10 of 1.0 mu g per cubic meter was associated with an increase of 0.10 mu m(2) (95 percent confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.18) in the carbon content of airway macrophages, and each increase of 1.0 mu m(2) in carbon content was associated with a reduction of 17 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.6 to 28.4 percent) in forced expiratory volume in one second, of 12.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 24.8 percent) in forced vital capacity, and of 34.7 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 11.3 to 58.1 percent) in the forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of the forced vital capacity. The carbon content of airway macrophages was lower in children with asthma than in healthy children. Conclusions There is a dose-dependent inverse association between the carbon content of airway macrophages and lung function in children. We found no evidence that reduced lung function itself causes an increase in carbon content.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are instrumental in the defense of viral infections, are present in reduced amounts in the skin of patients with AD, which is characterized by a high susceptibility to viral infections. Objective: We explored phenotypical and functional characteristics of pDC in the peripheral blood of patients with AD and healthy individuals. Methods: Blood dendritic cell antigen-2(+)CD123(+) pDCs were enriched from the peripheral blood of patients with AD and studied in functional assays. Results: Skin-homing molecules such as cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and L-selectin CD62L were expressed in lower levels on pDCs of patients with AD. pDCs expressed high amounts of IgE-occupied FcepsilonRI. Further, FcepsilonRI aggregation on pDCs impaired the surface expression of MHC I and II, induced the production of IL-10, and enhanced the apoptosis of pDCs. Importantly, FcepsilonRI preactivated pDC produced less IFN-alpha and IFN-beta after stimulation with CpG motifs and enhanced the outcome of immune responses of the T(H)2 type. Conclusion: From these data, we conclude that FcepsilonRI-bearing pDCs from patients with AD (1) are different from pDCs of healthy individuals, (2) might be important in the pathophysiology of AD, and (3) contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of patients with AD to viral infections.

Logistic regression models adjusted for potentially confounding variables, which generally had no effect on the coefficients for the antioxidants. Serum vitamin E had little or no association with asthma. In separate models, a SD increase in beta-carotene (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7, 1.0), vitamin C (OR, 0.8; 95% Cl, 0.7,0.9), and selenium (OR, 0.9; 95% Cl, 0.7, 1.1) was associated with a 10-20% reduction in asthma prevalence. Serum cotinine was used to identify youth with no cigarette smoke exposure and passive exposure (7%): Active smokers were too few to be studied further. The selenium-asthma association was stronger in youth who were smoke exposed (p = 0.075). A SD increase in selenium was associated with a 50% reduction in asthma prevalence (OR, 0.5; 95% Cl, 0.2, 1.4) in youth with passive smoke exposure compared with a 10% reduction in youth with no smoke exposure. The findings support an association of antioxidants with prevalent asthma, which for some antioxidants is stronger among children exposed to cigarette smoke.

Study design: The Israeli Teratogen Information Service (TIS) prospectively collected and followed 311 pregnancies counseled regarding systemic use of different GCS in the first trimester. The rate of major congenital anomalies was compared to that of 790 controls who were counseled for non-teratogenic exposure. Results: The rate of major anomalies did not significantly differ between the groups [12/262 = 4.6% (GCS), 19/728 = 2.6% (control), P = 0.116]. There was no case of oral cleft and no pattern of anomalies among the GCS exposed group. Higher rates of miscarriages (11.5% versus 7.0%, P = 0.013) and preterm births (22.7% versus 10.8%, P < 0.001) were observed among the GCS exposed group compared to the controls. GCS exposed infants had a lower median birth weight [3080g versus 3290g, P < 0.001] and were born at an earlier median gestational age [39 weeks versus 40, P < 0.001] compared to the control. Conclusions: The present study supports that GCS do not represent a major teratogenic risk in humans. The study was powered to find a 2.5-fold increase in the overall rate of major anomalies.

Method: A birth cohort of genetically at risk infants was recruited in 1990 to a randomised controlled study. Allergen avoidance measures were instituted from birth in the prophylactic group (n=58). Infants were either breast fed with mother on a low allergen diet or given an extensively hydrolysed formula. Exposure to house dust mite was reduced by the use of an acaricide and mattress covers. The control group (n=62) followed standard advice as normally given by the health visitors. At age 8, all 120 children completed a questionnaire and 110 (92%) had all assessments (skin prick test, spirometry, and bronchial challenges). Results: In the prophylactic group eight children (13.8%) had current wheeze compared with 17 (27.4%) in the control group (p=0.08). Respective figures were eight (13.8%) and 20 (32.3%) for nocturnal cough (p=0.02) and 11 of 55 (20.0%) and 29 of 62 (46.8%) for atopy (p=0.003). After adjusting for confounding variables, the prophylactic group was found to be at a significantly reduced risk for current wheeze (odds ratio (OR) 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.96)), nocturnal cough (OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.83)), asthma as defined by wheeze and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.02)), and atopy (OR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.62)). Conclusion: Strict allergen avoidance in infancy in high risk children reduces the development of allergic sensitisation to house dust mite.

We examined the relation between day care in the first year of life and asthma, recurrent wheezing, and eczema at the age of 6 years and wheezing in the first 6 years of life among 453 children with parental history of atopy followed from birth. Among all study participants, day care in the first year of life was inversely associated with eczema (odds ratio [OR] = 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.8). Day care attendance in early life was associated with a decreased risk of asthma (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7) and recurrent wheezing (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9) at the age of 6 years and with a decreased risk of any wheezing after the age of 4 years only among children without maternal history of asthma. Among children with maternal history of asthma, day care in early life had no protective effect on asthma or recurrent wheezing at the age of 6 years but was instead associated with an increased risk of wheezing in the first 6 years of life. Our findings suggest that maternal history of asthma influences the relation between day care-related exposures and childhood asthma.

During the past few years, several attempts have been made to refine diagnostic assays in clinical allergy by introducing recombinant allergens and novel markers of IgE-dependent cell activation. Objectives: We have identified the ectoenzyme CD203c as a novel basophil antigen that is upregulated on IgE receptor cross-linkage. In this study A e applied CD203c and a panel of recombinant allergens to establish a novel basophil test that,allows for a reliable quantification of IgE-dependent responses at the effector cell level. Methods: Patients allergic to birch (Bet v, 1, n = 15; Bet v 2, n := 8) and grass (Phl p 1, n = 15; Phl p 2, n = 10; Phl p 5, n = 14) pollen allergens, as well as 10 nonallergic donors, were examined. Basophils were exposed to various concentrations of recombinant allergens for 15 minutes and then examined for expression of CD203c by means of flow cytometry. CD203c upregulation was correlated with the increase in CD63. Results: Exposure to recombinant allergens resulted in a dose-dependent increase in expression of CD203c on peripheral blood basophils in sensitized individuals, whereas no increase,was seen in healthy control subjects. The effects of the recombinant allergens on CD203c expression were also time dependent. There was a good correlation between allergen-induced upregulation of CD203c and upregulation of CD63 (R = 0.76). Conclusion: Flow cytometric quantitation of CD203c on blood basophils exposed to recombinant allergens is a useful approach to determine the allergic state in sensitized individuals and represents a basis for a sensitive novel allergy test.

The influence of the expiratory flow rate during the collection maneuver on the ability of FENO to discriminate healthy subjects from those with asthma is unknown. We compared online and offline measurement of FENO at different flow rates. FENO was collected with expiratory flows of 50-500 ml/second in 34 patients with asthma (PC20 of less than 8 mg/ml) and 28 healthy subjects (PC20 of more than 10 mg/ml) using offline collection techniques. In a subgroup of 18 individuals with asthma and 17 healthy subjects, we additionally measured FENO at multiple expiratory flow rates (47-250 ml/second) using online methods. FENO fell with an increasing expiratory flow rate; FENO was higher in subjects with asthma as compared with healthy subjects at each flow rate studied with both techniques (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the diagnosis of asthma indicated that FENO is a robust discriminator between individuals with asthma and healthy subjects (area under the ROC curves 0.79 +/- 0.06 to 0.86 +/- 0.06, p for significant discrimination < 0.0001). Neither expiratory flow rate nor collection technique (online versus offline) significantly altered this discriminatory capacity (area under the ROC curves = 0.84 +/- 0.07 with the slowest online method versus 0.80 +/- 0.07 with the fastest offline method, p = 0.46). These data indicate that the choice of expiratory flow rate and collection method can be based on practicality and patient comfort without compromising the utility of this test for asthma.

A higher microbial exposure in general and in particular to endotoxin in early childhood might contribute to this lower risk of atopy. Objective We examined whether the presence of pets or vermin in the home is associated with higher endotoxin concentrations in settled house dust. Methods House dust was sampled in a standardized manner on the living room floors of 454 homes of German children aged 5-10 years (participation rate 61%). Endotoxin was assessed with a quantitative kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) method. Associations between endotoxin levels, pets and vermin are presented as ratios of the crude and confounder adjusted geometric means (means ratios) in the category of study vs. a reference category using multiple linear regression models. Results Endotoxin concentrations in living room floor dust sampled in homes without pets and vermin were lower (1246 ng per square meter, 1519 no, endotoxin/g dust, n = 157) than those sampled in homes with pets or vermin (2267 ng per square meter, 2200 ng endotoxin/g dust, n = 296). After adjustment for city of residence, season of dust sampling, age of the building and story of the dwelling, means ratios for endotoxin expressed per gram of dust were statistically significantly increased for dog (1.64, 95% Cl 1.09-2.46), for cat (1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.18) and for cockroach (3.01, 95% CI 1.37-6.60), whereas no major statistically significant associations were found for other pets, ants and mice. Conclusion Keeping a dog or, a cat in the home is consistent with higher exposure to endotoxin and might therefore contribute to the lower risk of atopy in later life.

Eventually this disease came to be known as allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFS), As clinical evidence of AFS accumulated, controversy regarding its etiology, pathogenesis, natural history, and appropriate treatment naturally emerged. Despite past and current efforts, many of these controversies remain incompletely resolved, but continuing clinical study has illuminated some aspects of the disease and has Zed to an improved understanding of AFS and its treatment. Fungi associated with the development of AFS are ubiquitous and predominantly of the dematiaceous family, The eosinophilic host response to the presence of these fungi within the nose and paranasal sinuses gives rise to those clinical manifestations of the disease (nasal polyps, expansile mucocele formation, allergic fungal mucin, etc.). Exposure alone to these fungi, however, appears to be insufficient to initiate the disease. At the present time it is likely that initiation of the inflammatory cascade leading to AFS is a multifactorial event, requiring the simultaneous occurrence of such things as IgE-mediated sensitivity (atopy), specific T-cell HLA receptor expression, exposure to specific fungi, and aberration of local mucosal defense mechanisms. A variety of treatment plans for AFS have emerged, but the potential for recidivism remains well recognized, ranging from 10% to nearly 100% suggesting the need for continued study of this disease and fueling present controversy. This article is intended to review current data and theories regarding the pathophysiology of AFS, as well as the role of various surgical and nonsurgical forms of therapy.

A potential but unproven route of occult exposure resulting in sensitization to peanut is via breast milk during lactation. Objective To investigate the ability of maternal dietary peanut protein to pass into breast milk during lactation, Design and Setting Clinical investigation conducted at 2 North American hospitals from March 1999 to October 2000, Patients Twenty-three healthy, lactating women aged 21 to 35 years. Intervention Each woman consumed 50 g of dry roasted peanuts, after which breast milk samples were collected at hourly intervals. Main Outcome Measures Presence in breast milk of total peanut protein, analyzed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 2 major peanut allergens, Ara h 1 and Ara h 2, detected by immunoblot analysis. Results Peanut protein was detected in 11 of 23 subjects, It was detected in 10 subjects within 2 hours of ingestion and in 1 subject within 6 hours. The median peak peanut protein concentration in breast milk was 200 ng/mL (mean, 222 ng/mL; range, 120-430 ng/mL). Both major peanut allergens Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 were detected. Conclusions Peanut protein is secreted into breast milk of lactating women following maternal dietary ingestion, Exposure to peanut protein during breastfeeding is a route of occult exposure that may result in sensitization of at-risk infants.

The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is suggested in the injuries induced by DEP, though the generation of ROS has not been proven. The present study provided the first direct evidence of (OH)-O-. generation in the lungs of living mice after intratracheal instillation of DEP, using noninvasive L-band ESR spectroscopy and a membrane-impermeable nitroxyl probe. (OH)-O-. generation is confirmed with the enhancement of in vivo ESR signal decay rate of the probe. The decay rate at mid-thorax was significantly enhanced in DEP-treated mice compared to that in vehicle-treated mice. The enhancement was completely suppressed by the administration of either (OH)-O-. scavengers, catalase, or desferrioxamine, while the administration of SOD further increased the rate. The administration of Fenton's reagents into the lung also enhanced the decay rate of the probe at mid-thorax of mice. These results clearly provided evidence that the intratracheal exposure to DEP in mice produced (OH)-O-. in the lung through an iron-catalyzed reaction of superoxide/H2O2. This first direct evidence of (OH)-O-. generation in DEP-treated mice lung may be utilized to determine treatments for DEP-induced lung injury. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, increasing the dose of most inhaled drugs may only lead to an increase in side effects, since maximal clinical benefit is usually obtained with the currently recommended dosages. Improving the regional deposition of inhaled drugs may be a more effective way of modifying clinical response. Particle size is the most significant determinant of the deposition pattern of inhaled drugs. Optimum drug delivery to the conducting airways occurs with particles ranging from 2.5 to 6 mum; particles <2.5 <mu>m are deposited mainly in the alveoli where they may exert no pharmacodynamic effect and are rapidly absorbed, increasing the risk of systemic adverse events. Delivery devices can be compared by estimating the lung and systemic exposures, taking into account the efficacy and safety dose-response relationships for the drug-device combination. Current devices have profoundly different lung deposition profiles that could affect clinical efficacy when switching devices. Devices that achieve a high lung to systemic ratio for the inhaled drug are preferable.

Traffic counts at the domiciles of subjects ranged from 24 to 32,504 cars per 24 hours, with a median of 1,624. To investigate the relation of road traffic and allergies, we matched the data of the traffic inventory of Basel with those of the 820 participants of the SAPALDIA study (Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults), ages 18-60 years, who had completed a detailed respiratory health questionnaire and had undergone allergy testing (skin prick tests and serologic examinations). We observed a positive association with a sensitization to pollen that was most pronounced among persons with a duration of residence of at least 10 years. The odds ratios (adjusted for educational level, smoking behavior, number of siblings, age, sex, and family history of atopy) for cars, contrasting four exposure categories with the lowest quartile as referent category, were 1.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-4.38], 2.47 (95% CI = 1.06-5.73), and 2.83 (95% CI = 1.26-6.31). These results suggest that living on busy roads is associated with a higher risk for a sensitization to pollen and could possibly he interpreted as an indication for interactions between pollen and air pollutants. We did not, however, find a similar relation between motor vehicle traffic and hay fever or seasonal allergic symptoms, and we saw no trend that increasing traffic exposure was associated with a rise in sensitization rates to indoor allergens.

Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. There is a trend toward considering phenotype-specific treatment choices; however, this goal has not yet been achieved.	[Papadopoulos, N.

SCH527123, a novel CXCR2 antagonist, inhibits ozone-induced neutrophilia in healthy subjects	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						Anti-inflammatory; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; interleukin-8; myeloperoxidase; pharmacodynamics	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; HISTONE DEACETYLASE; ACTIVATION MARKERS; INDUCED SPUTUM; BONE-MARROW; ASTHMA; COPD; RECRUITMENT; EXPOSURES	SCH527123 is a novel, selective CXC chemokine receptor 2 antagonist that inhibits neutrophil activation and modulates neutrophil trafficking in animal models, characteristics that may be beneficial in the treatment of conditions with unbalanced pulmonary neutrophilia, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this proof-of-principle study was to determine whether SCH527123 inhibits ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment in healthy humans. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study, oral SCH527123 (50 mg once daily, 4 days), prednisolone (50 mg once), or placebo was alternated with 2-week washouts. 18 healthy ozone responders (>20% increase in sputum neutrophils) underwent ozone challenge tests (250 ppb, 3 h intermittent exercise) 1 h after the last treatment dose. Sputum was induced at 3 h post-challenge. After SCH527123 treatment, the ozone challenge resulted in significantly lower sputum neutrophil counts (0.13 x 10(6).mL(-1)) compared with prednisolone (0.84 x 10(6).mL(-1); p<0.001) or placebo (2.98 x 10(6).mL(-1); p<0.001). Comparable results were obtained for total cell count, percentage of sputum neutrophils, and for interleukin-8 and myeloperoxidase in sputum supernatant. Post-challenge, SCH527123 inhibited neutrophilia in peripheral blood but significantly less than in sputum. All treatments were safe and well tolerated. SCH527123 causes significant attenuation of ozone-induced airway neutrophilia in healthy subjects. Further evaluation in a large trial of patients with pulmonary disorders is warranted.

However, the molecular mechanism of CS-mediated reduction of HDAC2 is not clearly known. We hypothesized that HDAC2 is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome in vitro in macrophages (MonoMac6), human bronchial and primary small airway epithelial cells, and in vivo in mouse lungs in response to chronic CS exposure. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure in MonoMac6 and in bronchial and airway epithelial cells led to phosphorylation of HDAC2 on serine/threonine residues by a protein kinase CK2-mediated mechanism, decreased HDAC2 activity, and increased ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent HDAC2 degradation. CK2 and proteasome inhibitors reversed CSE-mediated HDAC2 degradation, whereas serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, caused phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of HDAC2. CS-induced HDAC2 phosphorylation was detected in mouse lungs from 2 weeks to 4 months of CS exposure, and mice showed significantly lower lung HDAC2 levels. Thus, CS-mediated down-regulation of HDAC2 in human macrophages and lung epithelial cells in vitro and in mouse lung in vivo involves the induction of serine/threonine phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, which may have implications for steroid resistance and abnormal inflammation caused by cigarette smoke.

The present study was designed to evaluate the utility of illness perceptions and medication beliefs in predicting secondary preventive behaviour among patients with CHD. An extended version of Leventhal's self-regulatory model (SRM) was used as a theoretical framework for this study [Leventhal H, Nerenz DR, Steele DJ. Illness perceptions and coping with health threat. In: Baum A, Taylor SE, Singer JE, editors. Handbook of psychology and health, Volume IV: social psychological aspects of health. Hillsdale (NJ): Erlbaum,1984. pp. 21952; Home R, Weinman J. Self-regulation and self-management in asthma: exploring the role of illness perceptions and treatment beliefs in explaining non-adherence to preventer medication. Psychol Health 2002;17(l):17-32]. Method: Medical and demographic data were gathered from the medical charts of 1611 patients with established C14D from 35 randomly selected general practices. Self-report data about patients' lifestyles (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption and medication adherence) and information on illness and medication beliefs were provided from postal questionnaire (1084 patients responded; 69% response rate). The relationship between patients' beliefs and their secondary preventive behaviour was examined using regression analyses. Results: Illness perceptions appeared to be only weak predictors of smoking, exercise, diet, alcohol consumption and medication adherence, accounting for about 2% of the variance in these behaviours. Medication beliefs were moderately related to medication adherence, accounting for about 7% of the variance in scores. A strong belief in the necessity of one's medication and a lower level of concern about one's medication were associated with higher levels of adherence. Conclusions: An illness perception approach did not prove helpful in predicting secondary preventive behaviour among this group of patients. However, beliefs about medications appear to be reasonable predictive of medication adherence. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As a result, mapping genes that influence asthma susceptibility has been challenging. Objective: This study tests the hypothesis that inclusion of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), a potential risk factor for asthma, would improve the ability to map genes for asthma. Methods: By using 144 white families from the Collaborative Study for the Genetics of Asthma, environmental information about exposure to ETS during infancy was incorporated into a genome-wide multipoint linkage analysis. Statistical significance of observed gene-environment interactions was assessed by means of simulation. Results: Three regions with nominal evidence for linkage when stratified on the basis of ETS exposure were identified (P < .01) and showed a significant increase from the baseline lod score (1p at 97 cM, D1S1669-D1S1665; 5q at 135 cM, D5S1505-D5S816; and 9q at 106 cM, D9S910; all P < .05). In addition, 2 other regions, although not meeting nominal significance after stratification on the basis of ETS exposure, showed a significant increase from baseline lod score when ETS was taken into account (1q at 240 cM, D1S549; 17p at 3 cM, D17S1308; all P < .01). Conclusion: These results illustrate how evidence for linkage of asthma can depend on exposure to an environmental factor, such as ETS. Future linkage analyses should include information on suspected environmental factors for asthma to help target new candidate susceptibility genes for asthma.

We hypothesized that in utero exposure affects lung function in children without asthma and synergistically affects children with early onset asthma. To investigate ate effects of in utero exposure and age at asthma diagnosis on lung function, we examined longitudinal medical history, tobacco smoke exposure, and lung function data from 5,933 participants in the Children's Health Study. We found that children exposed in utero, but without asthma, showed decreased FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, and FEF25-75/FVC ratio. Among children without in utero exposure, early asthma diagnosis was associated. with larger decreases in FEV1, FEF25-75, and FEV1/FVC ratio compared with later diagnosed asthma. Children with in utero exposure alone and early onset asthma showed deficits in FEV1 (-13.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -18.9 to -8.2) and FEF25-75 (-29.7%; 95% Cl, -37.8 to -20.5) among boys; and FEF25-75 (-26.6%; 95% Cl, -36.4 to -15.1) and FEV1/FVC (-9.3%; 95% Cl, -12.9 to -5.4) among girls. The absolute differences in FEF25-75 associated with in utero exposure increased with age in children with early onset asthma.

Previous studies have indicated associations between immune system factors and the incidence of adult glioma, specifically that those individuals with certain allergic conditions may have decreased risk of glioma. We obtained detailed allergy histories for 405 adults newly diagnosed with glioma in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1997-1999 and 402 age-gender-ethnicity frequency-matched population-based controls. Seventy-nine percent of eligible cases or their proxies and 74% of eligible controls completed in-person interviews about allergies, age at onset, frequency, duration and severity. Overall, cases were less likely than controls to report any allergy (72% vs. 85%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.5 [0.3-0.7]); for self-reported cases (n = 269), OR = 0.7 (0.4-0.97) and for proxy-reported cases, OR = 0.3 (0.2-0.5). Pollen, dairy and nut allergies were significantly less common in cases than controls and most other allergens had odds ratios of less than one. There were no apparent trends with numbers of symptoms, route of exposure of allergen or reported severity of allergy, but there was a significant dose-response with increasing numbers of allergens (p < 0.0001 for linear trend among all cases vs. controls and p = 0.02 among self-reported cases only vs. controls). Although our work displays strong and consistent associations, future efforts must attempt to establish whether an immune system typified by proclivity to allergies, or an immunologic consequence of the allergies themselves, might be capable of preventing nascent brain tumors. The dominance of humoral immunity in the central nervous system is consistent with either of these models. Alternatively, common genetic or environmental causes for allergies and gliomagenesis may mediate or confound these observed inverse risks for allergies and gliomas, or other explanations may exist. Future work might reveal an important role for immunologic factors in gliomagenesis and potential preventative and/or therapeutic modalities. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A questionnaire was administered and skin prick testing and home visits for collection of dust samples (Fel d 1; ELISA) were performed in 2502 adults (mean age, 31.8 years; age range, 18-58 years; 1251 women). The results for Fel d 1 in relation to sensitization to cats were analyzed for 10 deciles of cat allergen exposure (cut points [mug/g]: 0.05, 0.34, 0.48, 0.72, 1.13, 1.92, 7.2, 44, 151). The prevalence of sensitization to cat was significantly decreased in the lowest and the highest exposure groups. In the multivariate regression analysis (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and current smoking being adjusted for), the risk of sensitization to cats was significantly increased with medium exposure to Fel d 1 (3rd centile, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4, P = .01; 4th centile, OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0, P = .03; 5th centile, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.3, P = .04, 6th centile, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.9, P = .005). These results indicate that the prevalence of sensitization to cat is decreased in the lowest and highest cat allergen exposure groups.

However, asthma guidelines are rarely completely up-to-date because our knowledge about the pathophysiology and treatment of asthma is continually evolving. Guidelines are an increasingly familiar part of clinical practice and may have potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of guidelines can be minimized if they are rigorously developed using evidence-based medicine. Guidelines should identify key decisions and their consequences and should review the consequences of alternative decisions. In addition, guidelines should be simple, user-friendly and widely disseminated. Guidelines evolve over time and their recommendations should be supported by evidence from clinical trials. Evidence-based medicine is the new paradigm but the results and reaction to the recent meta-analysis on house-dust mite control measures highlights the need for care when incorporating such information into guidelines. Newer therapeutic agents such as the leukotriene receptor antagonists are included in the most recent revision of the GINA guidelines, but their position in asthma therapy is not yet fully established. In countries where asthma guidelines have been implemented, there appears to have been a reduction in the prevalence of moderate persistent asthma but no decrease in severe asthma. This indicates that there is still room for improvement.

Proportional classifications of COPD phenotypes	THORAX			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; LUNG-FUNCTION; REFERENCE VALUES; VENN-DIAGRAM; RISK-FACTORS; MILD ASTHMA; FOLLOW-UP; POPULATION; PREVALENCE	Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) encompasses a group of disorders characterised by the presence of incompletely reversible airflow obstruction with overlapping subsets of different phenotypes including chronic bronchitis, emphysema or asthma. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of adult subjects aged > 50 years within each phenotypic subgroup of COPD, defined as a post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC) < 0.7, in accordance with current international guidelines. Methods: Adults aged > 50 years derived from a random population-based survey undertook detailed questionnaires, pulmonary function tests and chest CT scans. The proportion of subjects in each of 16 distinct phenotypes was determined based on combinations of chronic bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, with and without incompletely reversible airflow obstruction defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC ratio of 0.7. Results: A total of 469 subjects completed the investigative modules, 96 of whom (20.5%) had COPD. Diagrams were constructed to demonstrate the relative proportions of the phenotypic subgroups in subjects with and without COPD. 18/96 subjects with COPD (19%) had the classical phenotypes of chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema but no asthma; asthma was the predominant COPD phenotype, being present in 53/96 (55%). When COPD was defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC less than the lower limit of normal, there were one-third fewer subjects with COPD and a smaller proportion without a defined emphysema, chronic bronchitis or asthma phenotype. Conclusion: This study provides proportional classifications of the phenotypic subgroups of COPD which can be used as the basis for further research into the pathogenesis and treatment of this heterogeneous disorder.

Eosinophils: Singularly destructive effector cells or purveyors of immunoregulation?	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						eosinophil; immunoregulation; inflammation; innate; antigen presentation; granulocyte	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; MAST-CELLS; CHEMOTACTIC ACTIVITIES; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; LYMPH-NODES; T-CELLS; EXPRESSION; IL-4; ANTIGEN; ASTHMA	Eosinophils are granulocytes typically associated with immune responses to a limited number of specific insults, including helminth infection and exposure to various allergens. Moreover, the overwhelming consensus from the literature is that eosinophils evolved as uniquely destructive leukocytes with cytotoxic activities as an adaptation for host defense. However, recent studies now suggest that the parochial caricature of eosinophils as effector cells with nonspecific killing abilities that evolved as a host defense mechanism against large nonphagotizable parasites is incomplete. A new paradigm has emerged describing eosinophils as initial responders to cell death/tissue damage that are a part of remodeling/repair processes and, more importantly, significant contributors to localized innate and acquired immune responses as well as systemic adaptive immunity. Significantly, this new paradigm does not preclude roles for cosinophils in host defense leading to tissue damage but instead suggests the equal importance of eosinophil-associated regulatory mechanisms modulating local tissue immune responses. The goal of this review is to summarize the data in support of this new paradigm. In turn, we believe that this expanded role provides a probable explanation for the presence of eosinophils in diverse disease settings such as asthma, allergy, cancer, transplant rejection, gastrointestinal inflammation, and viral or helminth infection.

Investigations such as the Framingham Heart Study have produced blueprints for disease prevention and saved millions of lives and billions of dollars. To discover preventable environmental risk factors for disease in children, the US Congress directed the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, through the Children's Health Act of 2000, to conduct the National Children's Study. The National Children's Study is hypothesis-driven and will seek information on environmental risks and individual susceptibility factors for asthma, birth defects, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and obesity, as well as for adverse birth outcomes. It will be conducted in a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 100 000 US-born children. Children will be followed from conception to 21 years of age. Environmental exposures (chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial) will be assessed repeatedly during pregnancy and throughout childhood in children's homes, schools, and communities. Chemical assays will be performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and banks of biological and environmental samples will be established for future analyses. Genetic material will be collected on each mother and child and banked to permit study of gene-environment interactions. Recruitment is scheduled to begin in 2007 at 7 Vanguard Sites and will extend to 105 sites across the United States. The National Children's Study will generate multiple satellite studies that explore methodologic issues, etiologic questions, and potential interventions. It will provide training for the next generation of researchers and practitioners in environmental pediatrics and will link to planned and ongoing prospective birth cohort studies in other nations. Data from the National Children's Study will guide development of a comprehensive blueprint for disease prevention in children.

The specific protective environmental factors responsible are not yet identified. Objective: We sought to determine whether farmers' children in the rural county of Shropshire, England, have a reduced risk of atopy and, if so, to identify the factors responsible. Methods: The Study of Asthma and Allergy in Shropshire was a 2-stage cross-sectional study. In stage 1 a questionnaire to elicit allergic status, diet, and farming exposure was completed by the parents of 4767 children. In stage 2 a stratified subsample of 879 children underwent skin prick testing and measurement of domestic endotoxin. Results: Compared with rural nonfarming children, farmers' children had significantly less current asthma symptoms. (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91; P =.01) and current seasonal allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P =.002) but not current eczema symptoms (adjusted OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.68-1.21; P =.53) or atopy (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.40-1.16; P =.15). In contrast, current unpasteurized milk consumption was associated with significantly less current eczema symptoms (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87; P =.008) and a greater reduction in atopy (adjusted OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.53; P =.001). The effect was seen in all children, independent of farming status. Unpasteurized milk consumption was associated with a 59% reduction in total IgE levels (P <.001) and higher production of whole blood stimulated IFN-gamma (P = .02). Conclusion: Unpasteurized milk consumption was the exposure mediating the protective effect on skin prick test positivity. The effect was independent of farming status and present with consumption of infrequent amounts of unpasteurized milk. Clinical implications: Unpasteurized milk might be a modifiable influence on allergic sensitization in children.

We deployed diffusion tubes to measure NO2 levels at 39 locations in the fall of 2003 in San Diego County, CA, USA. At each sample location, we constructed circular buffers in a geographic information system and captured information on roads, traffic flow, land use, population and housing. Using multiple linear regression, we were able to predict 79% of the variation in NO2 levels with four variables: traffic density within 40-300m of the sampling location, traffic density within 300-1000m, length of road within 40m and distance to the Paci. c coast. Applying this model to validation samples showed that the model predicted NO2 levels within, on average, 2.1 p.p.b for 12 training sites initially excluded from t he model. Our evaluation of this land use regression model showed that this method had excellent prediction and robustness in a North American context.

Objective Our cross-sectional study was intended to analyse the associations between long-term exposure to background air pollution and atopic and respiratory outcomes in a large population-based sample of schoolchildren. Methods Six thousand six hundred and seventy-two children aged 9-11 years recruited from 108 randomly schools in six French cities underwent a clinical examination including a skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (EIB) and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire completed by the parents. Three-year-averaged concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10 and O-3) were calculated at children' schools using measurements of background monitoring stations. Results After adjusting for confounders, EIB, lifetime asthma and lifetime AR were found to be positively related to an increase in the exposure to SO2, PM10 and O-3. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) per increase of 5 mu g/m(3) of SO2 was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-1.66) for EIB and 1.19 (1.00-1.41) for lifetime asthma. The aOR for lifetime AR per increase of 10 mu g/m(3) of PM10 was 1.32 (CI=1.04-1.68). Moreover, SPT positivity was associated with O-3 (aOR=1.34; CI=1.24-1.46). Associations with past year symptoms were consistent, even if not always statistically significant. Results persisted in long-term resident (current address for at least 8 years) children. However, no consistent positive association was found with NO2. Conclusions A moderate increase in long-term exposure to background ambient air pollution was associated with an increased prevalence of respiratory and atopic indicators in children.
