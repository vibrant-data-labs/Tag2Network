It contains more than several hundred different organic and inorganic components, including many chemicals that have been designated as toxic air pollutants. Because mutagens and carcinogens are present in both the gaseous and particulate components, lung cancer has been the focus of attention as a health risk in animal and human research. Moreover, since the epidemiologic data suggest carcinogenicity in humans, and the diesel exhaust exposure data in evaluations in rats by NIOSH, IARC, WHO, and the California EPA, are said to demonstrate or support carcinogenicity, agencies have designated them as latent occupational carcinogens (NIOSH) or toxic air pollutants (California EPA). In regard to their non-carcinogenic effects, a contribution to airway inflammation and allergies, and in relation to disease, the possibility of contracting asthma and chronic bronchitis, have been investigated both experimentally and epidemiologically, and concern has increased about their health effects, particularly in children.

Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Liverpool Health Service and Macarthur Health Service in outer metropolitan Sydney between September 1999 and July 2000. Participants 177 patients randomised into an intervention group (84 patients) and a control group (93 patients) which received current usual care. Interventions Home visits by community nurse at one and four weeks after discharge and preventive general practitioner care. Main outcome measures Frequency of patients' presentation and admission to hospital; changes in patients' disease-specific quality of life, measured with St George's respiratory questionnaire, over three months after discharge; patients' knowledge of illness, self management, and satisfaction with care at discharge and three months later; frequency of general practitioner and nurse visits and their satisfaction with care. Results Intervention and control groups showed no differences in presentation or admission to hospital or in overall functional status. However, the intervention group improved their activity scores and the control group worsened their symptom scores. While intervention group patients received more visits from community nurses and were more satisfied with their care, involvement of general practitioners was much less (with only 31% (22) remembering receiving a care plan). Patients in the intervention group had higher knowledge scores and were more satisfied. There were no differences in general practitioner visits or management. Conclusions This brief intervention after acute care improved patients' knowledge and some aspects of quality of life. However, it failed to prevent presentation and readmission to hospital.

However, the role of human DCs in the pathogenesis of the Th2 cell-mediated disease asthma remains to be clarified. Here, by using SCID mice engrafted with T cells from either house dust mite (HDM)-allergic patients or healthy donors, we show that DCs pulsed with Der p 1, one of the major allergens or HDM, and injected intratracheally into naive animals migrated into the MLN. In the NILN, Der p I-pulsed DCs from allergic patients induced the proliferation of IL-4-producing CD4(+) T cells, whereas those from healthy donors induced IFN-gamma-secreting cells. In reconstituted human PBM C-reconstituted SCID mice primed with pulsed DCs from allergic patients, repeated exposure to aerosols of HDM induced 1) a strong pulmonary inflammatory reaction rich in T cells and eosinophils, 2) an increase in IL-4 and IL-5 production in the lung lavage fluid, and 3) increased IgE production compared with that in mice primed with unpulsed DCs. All these effects were reduced following in vivo neutralization of the CCR7 ligand secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine. These data in human PBMC-reconstituted SCID mice show that monocyte-derived DCs might play a key role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary allergic response by inducing Th2 effector function following migration to the MLN.

To determine whether celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, cross-reacts in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) with asthma. Methods. Sixty patients with asthma underwent double-blinded, placebo-controlled oral challenges with celecoxib (100 mg, 200 mg, and 2 placebos) over 48 hours in our General Clinical Research Center. The next day, sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was proven in all patients with the use of single-blinded ASA challenges. Results. None of the 60 patients experienced any symptoms, changes in nasal examinations, or declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 second during the celecoxib challenges. All 60 patients experienced oculo-nasal and/or asthmatic reactions to ASA, with a mean provoking dose of 69 mg. The exact 1-sided confidence interval for the probability of celecoxib inducing cross-reactions in AERD patients was calculated to be between 0% and 5%. Conclusion. Cross-reactivity between ASA and celecoxib does not occur in patients with AERD. These results do not preclude the possibility of other types of immune reactions occurring with celecoxib after prior exposure. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that inhibition of COX-1 is a critical initiating event in the precipitation of respiratory reactions in AERD patients following ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

We applied a model based on the classical Fick's first law of diffusion to partition NO in the lungs. The aim was to develop a simple and robust solution algorithm with a data quality control feature, and apply it to patients with known alterations in exhaled NO. Subjects with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) smokers and controls were investigated. NO was measured at three expiratory flow rates. An iteration method was developed to partition NO. The airway tissue content of NO was increased in asthma, 144 +/- 80 ppb (P = 0(.)04) and decreased in smokers, 56 +/- 36 ppb (P = 0(.)02). There was no difference between subjects with rhinitis, 98 +/- 40 ppb and controls, 98 +/- 44 ppb. The airway transfer rate was increased in allergic asthma and allergic rhinithis, 12 +/- 4 vs. 12 +/- 5 ml sec(-1), compared to controls, 8 +/- 2 ml sec(-1) (P < 0(.)001). The alveolar levels were no different from controls, 2 +/- 1 ppb. In COPD the alveolar levels were increased, 4 +/- 2 ppb (P < 0(.)001). Extended NO analysis reveals from where in the respiratory system NO is generated.

This review examines the cellular actions of the organic and the particulate components of DEP in the development of various lung diseases. Both the organic and the particulate components cause oxidant lung injury. The particulate component is known to induce alveolar epithelial damage, alter thiol levels in alveolar macrophages (AM) and lymphocytes, and activate AM in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The organic component, on the other hand, is shown to generate intracellular ROS, leading to a variety of cellular responses including apoptosis. There are a number of differences between the biological actions exerted by these two components. The organic component is responsible-for DEP induction of cytochrome P450 family 1 enzymes that are critical to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitro-PAH metabolism in the lung as well as in the liver. The particulate component, on the other hand, causes a sustained down-regulation of CYP2B1 in the rat lung. The significance of this effect on pulmonary metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics remains to be seen, but may prove to be an important factor governing the interplay of the pulmonary metabolic and inflammatory systems. Long-term exposures to various particles including DEP, carbon black (CB), TiO(2), and washed DEP devoid of the organic content, have been shown to produce similar tumorigenic responses in rodents. There is a lack of correlation between tumor development and DEP chemical-derived DNA adduct formation. But the organic component has been shown to generate ROS that produce 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in cell culture. The organic, but not the particulate, component of DEP suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by AM and the development of Th1 cell-mediated immunity. The mechanism for this effect is not yet clear, but may involve the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cellular genetic response to oxidative stress. Both the organic and the particulate components of DEP enhance respiratory allergic sensitization. Part of the DEP effects may be due to a depletion of glutathione in lymphocytes. The organic component, which is shown to induce IL-4 and IL-10 productions, may skew the immunity toward Th2 response, whereas the particulate component may stimulate both the Th1 and Th2 responses. In conclusion, the literature shows that the particulate and organic components of DEP exhibit different biological actions but both involve the induction of cellular oxidative stress. Together, these effects inhibit cell-mediated immunity toward infectious agents, exacerbate respiratory allergy, cause DNA damage, and under long-term exposure, induce the development of lung tumors.

Immunotherapy may act by altering the local nasal mucosal T helper type 2 (Th2) to type 1 (Th1) cytokine balance either by down-regulation and/or immune deviation of T-lymphocyte responses. There is controversy as to whether these changes are detectable in peripheral blood. We therefore examined both local nasal and peripheral T-cell responses to allergen exposure in the same subjects before and after immunotherapy. In a double-blind trial of grass pollen immunotherapy, nasal biopsies were obtained at baseline and during the peak pollen season following 2 years of immunotherapy. Placebo-treated patients showed a seasonal increase in CD3(+) T cells (P=0.02) and in interleukin-5 (IL-5) mRNA(+) cells (P=0.03) and no change in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA(+) cells (P=0.2) in the nasal mucosa. In contrast, in the immunotherapy-treated group, there were no changes in the number of CD3(+) T cells (P=0.3) and IL-5 mRNA(+) cells (P=0.2) but a significant increase in the number of IFN-gamma mRNA(+) cells (P=0.03). Furthermore, clinical improvement in the immunotherapy-treated group was accompanied by a seasonal increase in the ratio of IFN-gamma to IL-5 mRNA(+) cells in the nasal mucosa (P=0.03). In contrast, there were no significant changes in peripheral T-cell proliferative responses or cytokine production for IFN-gamma or IL-5 in response to grass pollen either within or between the two treatment groups. We conclude that successful grass pollen immunotherapy was associated with an increase in the ratio of IFN-gamma to IL-5 mRNA(+) cells in the nasal mucosa, whereas these changes were not reflected by alterations in peripheral blood T-cell proliferative responses or cytokine production before/after treatment.

Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to examine clinical heterogeneity observed in asthma and allergic characteristics among 3 ethnic groups (African American, white, and Hispanic family members). Methods: pulmonary function parameters and asthma-associated phenotypes were compared among the ethnic groups. Results: In comparison with the other groups, African American sibling pairs had a significantly lower baseline FEV, percent of predicted (P = .0001) and a higher rate of skin test reactivity to cockroach allergen (P = .0001); Hispanic sibling pairs had significantly more skin reactivity overall (P = .001); and white sibling pairs had significantly lower total serum IgE (P < .05). In addition, there were significantly more relatives with asthma among the African American families than among the white and the Hispanic families (P = .001). Conclusion: Although different environmental backgrounds should be considered, these clinical differences could be due to differences in genetic susceptibility among the ethnic groups, such as those suggested by our previous genome screen.

Six hundred and sixteen pregnant women whose unborn children were at high risk of developing asthma because of a family history were randomized prenatally. Study groups are as follows: Group A (placebo diet intervention, no house dust mite reduction), Group B (placebo diet intervention, active house dust mite reduction), Group C (active diet intervention, no house dust mite reduction), and Group D (active diet intervention, active house dust mite reduction). The house dust mite reduction intervention comprises use of physical and chemical methods to reduce allergen contact. The dietary intervention comprises use of a daily oil supplement from 6 months or at onset of bottle-feeding, and use of margarine and cooking oils based on sunflower or canola oils to increase omega-3 dietary intake. Data is collected quarterly until the infant is 1 year old and then half yearly until age 5 years. Questionnaires are used ti, collect respiratory illness history and information about diet and home environment. Dust is collected from the child's bed and bedroom and playroom floors. Blinded assessments are conducted at 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years. Skin prick tests to common allergens, blood tests, and detailed illness, medication use, and vaccination histories are collected. Primary outcomes will be the development of allergic sensitization and the presence and severity of asthma. This study is designed to measure the effectiveness of allergen reduction and dietary supplementation, both separately and in combination, for the primary prevention of atopy and asthma. The results of this study may have important implications for public health policies to reduce the incidence of childhood asthma. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 2001.

Exhaled NO was measured by an automatic chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers NO Analyser 280) at steady expiration. Men had significantly higher exhaled NO levels than women (p = 0.001). Although exhaled NO levels did not correlate with age (r = 0.12, p = 0.17), it correlated significantly with height (r = 0.23,p = 0.02), weight (r = 0.34,p < 0.001), body mass index (r = 0.25,p = 0.009), and body surface area (r = 0.42,p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. After making adjustment for age, height, weight, body mass index, and body surface area, exhaled NO levels were still significantly higher for men than for women (p = 0.004). Our data, therefore, could help explain the discrepancy in results of previous studies on exhaled NO production, which had not taken these parameters into account.

However, the precise role of NO in the lung inflammation is unknown. This study investigated the effect of both selective and nonselective iNOS inhibitors in an allergen-driven murine lung inflammation model. OVA challenge resulted in an accumulation of eosinophils and neutrophils in the airways. Expression of iNOS immunostaining in lung sections together with an increase in calcium-independent NOS activity in lung homogenates was also observed after OVA challenge. Treatment with iNOS inhibitors from the day of challenge to the day of sacrifice resulted in an inhibition of the inflammatory cell influx together with a down-regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. In contrast, eosinophilic and neutrophilic inhibition was not observed with treatment during the sensitization. Both treatments induced an increased production of Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) with a concomitant decrease in production of Thl-type cytokine (IFN-gamma). In vitro exposure of primary cultures of murine lung fibroblasts to a NO donor, hydroxylamine, induced a dose-dependent release of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Our results suggest that lung inflammation after allergen challenge in mice is partially dependent on NO produced mainly by iNOS. NO appears to increase lung chemokine expression and, thereby, to facilitate influx of inflammatory cells into the airways.

This 1999 study measured asthma prevalence among Latinos of different cultural traditions who live on the same streets and in the same buildings. Methods. Health promoters from El Puente in North Brooklyn, New York City, surveyed 3015 people in 946 households, asking standard asthma prevalence questions. Results. Some 46%, of households identified themselves as Dominican, 42% as Puerto Rican, 6% as other Latino, and 6% as other. Reported asthma period prevalence was 5.3% (93 of 1749) among Dominicans and other Latinos, compared with 13.2% (147 of 1115)among Puerto Ricans (odds ratio = 0.37; 95% confidence interval = 0.28, 0.49), a difference not explained by location (cluster or building), household size, use of home remedies, educational attainment, or country where education was completed. Differences were least detectable among 13- to 24-year-olds of both sexes and sharpest among women aged 45 years and older and girls from birth to 12 years. Conclusions, Further research oil gene-environment interactions is needed among Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, but asthma's associations with low income and unhealthy environment, which more recent immigrants seem better able to withstand, should not be overlooked.

Defective epithelial barrier in chronic rhinosinusitis: The regulation of tight junctions by IFN-gamma and IL-4	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Chronic rhinosinusitis; chronic sinusitis; tight junctions; occludin; claudin; zonula occludens; regulation; cytokines; leaky epithelium	HUMAN AIRWAY EPITHELIA; NASAL POLYPOSIS; CHRONIC SINUSITIS; CELLS; EXPRESSION; DISEASES; ASTHMA; DIFFERENTIATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFLAMMATION	Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease with still unclear pathophysiologic mechanisms. Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) have been shown to be involved in different chronic disorders, including bronchial asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases, and skin disorders. The regulation of epithelial barrier function and TJ expression has not been extensively studied in patients with CRS and in the paranasal sinus epithelium thus far. Objective: We sought to elucidate the TJ expression pattern in the epithelium of the sinonasal mucosa and its regulation in patients with CRS. Methods: Trans-tissue resistance was measured in biopsy specimens from healthy control subjects and patients with CRS with and without nasal polyps. TJ protein expression was determined by using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and real-time PCR. Primary epithelial cell cultures from patients with CRS and control subjects were used in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures for the measurement of transepithelial resistance (TER) and TJ expression. The effect of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-17 on ALI cultures was assessed. Results: A decreased trans-tissue resistance was found in biopsy specimens from patients with CRS with nasal polyps along with an irregular, patchy, and decreased expression of the TJ molecules occludin and zonula occludens 1. TER was reduced in ALI cultures from patients with CRS with nasal polyps. The cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-4 decreased TER, whereas IL-17 did not have any influence on epithelial integrity. Conclusion: A defective epithelial barrier was found in patients with CRS with nasal polyps along with a decreased expression of TJ proteins. The disruption of epithelial integrity by IFN-gamma and IL-4 in vitro indicates a possible role for these proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of patients with CRS.

The German 'Federal Institute for Risk Assessment' hosted an 'International Workshop on Contact Dermatitis'. The scope of the workshop was to discuss new discoveries and developments in the field of contact dermatitis. This included the epidemiology and molecular biology of contact allergy, as well as the development of new in vitro methods. Furthermore, it considered regulatory aspects aiming to reduce exposure to contact sensitisers. An estimated 15-20% of the general population suffers from contact allergy. Workplace exposure, age, sex, use of consumer products and genetic predispositions were identified as the most important risk factors. Research highlights included: advances in understanding of immune responses to contact sensitisers, the importance of autoxidation or enzyme-mediated oxidation for the activation of chemicals, the mechanisms through which hapten-protein conjugates are formed and the development of novel in vitro strategies for the identification of skin-sensitising chemicals. Dendritic cell cultures and structure-activity relationships are being developed to identify potential contact allergens. However, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) presently remains the validated method of choice for hazard identification and characterisation. At the workshop the use of the LLNA for regulatory purposes and for quantitative risk assessment was also discussed.

Of the four isoforms, p38 alpha is the most abundant in inflammatory cells and has been the most studied through mainly the availability of small molecule inhibitors. The p38 substrates include transcription factors; other protein kinases, which in turn phosphorylate transcription factors; cytoskeletal proteins and translational components; and other enzymes. Both asthma and COPD are characterized by chronic airflow obstruction, airway and lung remodeling, and chronic inflammation. p38 is involved in the inflammatory responses induced by cigarette smoke exposure, endotoxin, and oxidative stress through activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, posttranslational regulation of these genes, and activation of inflammatory cell migration. Inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented allergen-induced pulmonary eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness, effects that may partly result from p38 activation on eosinophil apoptosis and on airway smooth muscle cell production of cytokines/chemokines. In addition, p38 regulates the augmented contractile response induced by oxidative stress. The activation of p38 observed in epithelial cells and macrophages also may underlie corticosteroid insensitivity of severe asthma and COPD. Therefore, p38 inhibitors present a potential attractive treatment of these conditions. Second-generation p38 inhibitors have been disappointing in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In two 6-week studies in patients with COPD, the results were encouraging. Side effects such as liver toxicity remain a possibility, and whether the beneficial effects of p38 inhibitors are clinically significant and sustained need to be determined.

Understanding The Cumulative Impacts Of Inequalities In Environmental Health: Implications For Policy	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article							SELF-RATED HEALTH; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; HAZARDOUS-WASTE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; DISPARITIES	Racial or ethnic minority groups and low-income communities have poorer health outcomes than others. They are more frequently exposed to multiple environmental hazards and social stressors, including poverty, poor housing quality, and social inequality. Researchers are grappling with how best to characterize the cumulative effects of these hazards and stressors in order to help regulators and decision makers craft more-effective policies to address health and environmental disparities. In this article we synthesize the existing scientific evidence regarding the cumulative health implications of higher rates of exposure to environmental hazards, along with individual biological susceptibility and social vulnerability. We conclude that current environmental policy, which is focused narrowly on pollutants and their sources, should be broadened to take into account the cumulative impact of exposures and vulnerabilities encountered by people who live in neighborhoods consisting largely of racial or ethnic minorities or people of low socioeconomic status.

The purpose of this study was to measure Los Angeles's existing tree canopy cover (TCC), determine if space exists for 1 million additional trees, and estimate future benefits from the planting. High-resolution QuickBird remote sensing data, aerial photographs, and geographic information systems were used to classify land cover types, measure TCC, and identify potential tree planting sites. Benefits were forecast for planting of 1 million trees between 2006 and 2010, and their growth and mortality were projected until 2040. Two scenarios reflected low (17%) and high (56%) mortality rates. Numerical models were used with geographic data and tree size information for coastal and inland climate zones to calculate annual benefits and their monetary value. Los Angeles's existing TCC was 21%, and ranged from 7 to 37% by council district. There was potential to add 2.5 million additional trees to the existing population of approximately 10.8 million, but only 1.3 million of the potential tree sites are deemed realistic to plant. Benefits for the 1-million-tree planting for the 35-year period were $1.33 billion and $1.95 billion for the high- and low-mortality scenarios, respectively. Average annual benefits were $38 and $56 per tree planted. Eighty-one percent of total benefits were aesthetic/other, 8% were stormwater runoff reduction, 6% energy savings, 4% air quality improvement, and less than 1% atmospheric carbon reduction.

These effects result from a unique set of physical characteristics and surface moieties, which generate an ability of UFPs to enter tissues and cells, interact with proteins and DNA at a molecular level and directly and indirectly modulate the immune system by novel mechanisms. In recent years, a new field known as nanotechnology has impacted multiple industries by taking advantage of the special qualities of these small "atomic-sized" particles. Nanomedicine has already opened up a new avenue of research in cancer therapy, drug delivery and immune regulation. While the benefits of this new science to human civilization are seemingly immeasurable, it is also important to appreciate that these particles can also lead to harmful effects on human health. In vitro and animal studies are showing that nanoparticles and UFPs are capable of activating proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, with recruitment of inflammatory cells including basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. These changes may have an impact on immune defense, but also on the Th1/Th2 balance, and even on non-immunologic function. Resulting immune system derangement can lead to increases in incidence of autoimmune, allergic and even neoplastic diseases. Cardiorespiratory effects have been observed to occur in humans. Much further research is needed to establish safe exposure levels for this important new class of particulates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Areas covered in this review: We first summarize the biochemical regulation of 5-LO and the general pharmacological concepts in 5-LO inhibition by currently available compounds, and subsequently we report recent developments deduced from recent scientific publications and patents. What the reader will gain: A comprehensive overview about the different molecular pharmacological strategies to inhibit 5-LO and the most successful previous 5-LO inhibitors. The review also gives insights into novel concepts, for example, dual prostaglandin/LT synthesis inhibition and reveals novel compounds patented or developed within the past 5 years. Take home message: Despite the increasing therapeutic indications of anti-LT therapy, the progress in the development of novel 5-LO inhibitors is moderate. However, novel molecular concepts in the intervention with LT biosynthesis seem promising.

Silent mysteries: epigenetic paradigms could hold the key to conquering the epidemic of allergy and immune disease	ALLERGY			English	Review						acetylation; allergic disease; epigenetics; methylation; susceptibility	IFN-GAMMA PROMOTER; DNA METHYLATION CHANGES; T-CELL DIFFERENTIATION; FOXP3 GENE-EXPRESSION; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; IN-UTERO; HISTONE DEACETYLASES; TH2 DIFFERENTIATION; LINEAGE COMMITMENT; CYTOKINE RESPONSES	P>Epigenetic mechanisms provide new insights into how environmental changes may mediate the increasing propensity for complex immune diseases such as allergic disease. There is now strong evidence that early environmental exposures play a key role in activating or silencing genes by altering DNA and histone methylation, histone acetylation and chromatin structure. These modifications determine the degree of DNA compaction and accessibility for gene transcription, altering gene expression, phenotype and disease susceptibility. While there is already evidence that a number of early environmental exposures are associated with an increased risk of allergic disease, several new studies indicate in utero microbial and dietary exposures can modify gene expression and allergic disease propensity through epigenetic modification. This review explores the evidence that immune development is under clear epigenetic regulation, including the pattern of T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell differentiation, regulatory T cell differentiation, and more recently, Th17 development. It also considers the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and early immune defects in allergy prone neonates. The inherent plasticity conferred by epigenetic mechanisms clearly also provides opportunities for environmental strategies that can re-programme gene expression for disease prevention. Identifying genes that are differentially silenced or activated in relation to subsequent disease will not only assist in identifying causal pathways, but may also help identify the contributing environmental factors.

CYTOCHROME BC(1) COMPLEX; GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; CORE PROTEINS; ASTHMA; STRESS; POLLEN; CELLS; IDENTIFICATION	The prevalence of allergies and asthma among the world's population has been steadily increasing due to environmental factors. It has been described that exposure to ozone, diesel exhaust particles, or tobacco smoke exacerbates allergic inflammation in the lungs. These environmental oxidants increase the levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium. In this study, we investigated the involvement of preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction in the exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. After cellular oxidative insult induced by ragweed pollen extract (RWE) exposure, we have identified nine oxidatively damaged mitochondrial respiratory chain-complex and associated proteins. Out of these, the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core II protein (UQCRC2) was found to be implicated in mitochondrial ROS generation from respiratory complex III. Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by deficiency of UQCRC2 in airway epithelium of sensitized BALB/c mice prior the RWE challenge increased the Ag-induced accumulation of eosinophils, mucin levels in the airways, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Deficiency of UQCRC1, another oxidative damage-sensitive complex III protein, did not significantly alter cellular ROS levels or the intensity of RWE-induced airway inflammation. These observations suggest that preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction induced by oxidant environmental pollutants is responsible for the severe symptoms in allergic airway inflammation. These data also imply that mitochondrial defects could be risk factors and may be responsible for severe allergic disorders in atopic individuals. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 183: 5379-5387.

In a cross-sectional questionnaire survey, asthma symptoms, hay fever and eczema were assessed, as well as current, early and prenatal farm-related exposures in 1,333 farmers' children and 566 reference children aged 5-17 yrs. Farmers' children had a lower incidence of asthma symptoms and eczema. Current and maternal exposure during pregnancy to animals and/or grain and hay reduced the risk of asthma symptoms, hay fever and eczema. The exposure-response association for maternal exposure was nonlinear for most outcomes. After mutual adjustment, the effects of prenatal exposure remained unchanged whereas current exposure remained protective only for asthma medication, asthma ever and hay fever. Exposure during the first 2 yrs was not associated with symptoms, after controlling for prenatal exposure. A combination of prenatal and current exposure was most strongly associated with wheeze (odds ratio (OR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.80), asthma medication (OR 0.50, 95% Cl 0.30-0.82), asthma ever (OR 0.50, 95% Cl 0.33-0.76), hay fever (OR 0.47, 95% Cl 0.30-0.73) and eczema (OR 0.46, 95% Cl 0.30-0.70). Prenatal exposure may contribute to the low prevalence of asthma, hay fever and eczema in farmers' children, but continued exposure may be required to maintain optimal protection.

Clinical effects of immunotherapy with genetically modified recombinant birch pollen Bet v 1 derivatives	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						allergen variants; allergic rhinitis; allergy; Bet v 1; birch pollen; immunotherapy; recombinant allergens	BET V 1; ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY; QUANTITATIVE IGE INHIBITION; LATE ASTHMATIC REACTIONS; WILD-TYPE; VACCINATION; SENSITIVITY; TRANSITION; POPULATION; CANDIDATES	Background Birch pollen and pollen from related trees of the Fagales order are a major cause of allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma through the spring season in northern and central Europe. Objective To investigate the clinical effects of injection immunotherapy with genetically modified derivatives of major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 on pollen-induced allergic symptoms. Methods A three-arm double-blind placebo-controlled immunotherapy study was conducted with one pre-seasonal course of treatment using two derivatives of Bet v 1, namely a recombinant Bet v 1 trimer and an equimolar mixture of two recombinant Bet v 1 fragments together representing the whole protein sequence. Analysis of local and systemic adverse events was performed for 124 patients who had received at least one dose of medication. Clinical efficacy was monitored by symptom medication scores and interval scoring in the per protocol-treated population (n=84). In addition, skin and nasal provocation responses and allergen-specific antibodies were assessed. Results There were trends towards improvement in the subjects' well-being and clinical symptoms (nasal scores), although comparisons with a placebo group did not show statistical significance in the main end-point, the combined symptom medication score. Reductions in skin and nasal sensitivity were observed for some subjects with a trend for the Bet v 1 trimer to be more effective than the fragments. Treatment induced strong IgG1 and IgG4 allergen-specific antibody responses. Local injection-site reactions were most frequent in the trimer group affecting 59.5% of patients as opposed to 37.8% and 30.6% in the fragment and placebo groups, respectively. Systemic reactions were elicited more frequently by fragments. A large proportion of adverse side-effects appeared hours following injections, and might be attributable to concurrent exposure to related pollens. Conclusion Single courses of injection immunotherapy with Bet v 1 allergen derivatives showed trends towards improved well-being and reduced reactivity to specific allergen provocation, but did not yield significant improvement in the combined symptom medication score in this study.

We performed a systematic review of the randomized trials that had assessed the effects of reducing exposure to house dust mite antigens in the homes of people with mite-sensitive asthma, and had compared active interventions with placebo or no treatment. Fifty-four trials (3002 patients) were included. Thirty-six trials assessed physical methods (26 mattress covers), 10 chemical methods and eight a combination of chemical and physical methods. Despite the fact that many trials were of poor quality and would be expected to exaggerate the reported effect, we did not find an effect of the interventions. For the most frequently reported outcome, peak flow in the morning (1565 patients), the standardized mean difference was 0.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10). There were no statistically significant differences in number of patients improved (relative risk 1.01, 95% CI 0.80-1.27), asthma symptom scores (standardized mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.07) or in medication usage (standardized mean difference -0.06, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.07). Chemical and physical methods aimed at reducing exposure to house dust mite allergens cannot be recommended.	[Gotzsche, P. C.; Johansen, H.

Function and regulation of SPLUNC1 protein in mycoplasma infection and allergic inflammation	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							NASAL LAVAGE FLUID; CHLAMYDIA-PNEUMONIAE; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; COLLAGEN DEPOSITION; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; MUCIN EXPRESSION; MURINE MODEL; LUNG; ASTHMA; PLUNC	Respiratory infections, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp), contribute to asthma pathobiology. To date, the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of asthmatics to airway Mp infection remain unclear. Short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1) protein is a recently described large airway epithelial cell-derived molecule that was predicted to exert host defense activities. However, SPLUNC1 function and regulation in an infectious or allergic milieu are still unknown. We determined host defense and anti-inflammatory functions of SPLUNC1 protein in Mp infection and the regulation of SPLUNC1 by Mp and allergic inflammation (e.g., IL-13). SPLUNC1 function was examined in Mp or human airway epithelial cell cultures by using SPLUNC1 recombinant protein, overexpression and RNA interference. Human and mouse bronchial epithelial SPLUNC1 was examined using immunostaining, Western blotting, ELISA, laser capture microdissection, and real-time PCR. Mouse models of Mp infection and allergic inflammation and air-liquid interface cultures of normal human primary bronchial epithelial cells were used to study SPLUNC1 regulation by Mp and IL-13. We found that: 1) SPLUNC1 protein decreased Mp levels and inhibited epithelial IL-8 production induced by Mp-derived lipoproteins; 2) normal human and mouse large airway epithelial cells expressed high levels of SPLUNC1; and 3) although Mp infection increased SPLUNC1, IL-13 significantly decreased SPLUNC1 expression and Mp clearance. Our results suggest that SPLUNC1 serves as a novel host defense protein against Mp and that an allergic setting markedly reduces SPLUNC1 expression, which may in part contribute to the persistent nature of bacterial infections in allergic airways.

The aim of this review is to present the published knowledge on 6 historical epidemics of contact allergy to apply this knowledge on the prevention and control of future contact allergy epidemics. A historical review is performed on nickel, chromium, methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone, methyldibromo glutaronitrile, formaldehyde, and para-phenylenediamine. The first cases of contact dermatitis are mostly occupational, whereas consumer cases appear later. There is often a latency period from the first cases are observed until an epidemic occurs, and the problem is recognized. Finally, no one seems to take responsibility of dealing with the situation, and there are no attempts of regulation until an epidemic is consolidated among consumers for many years. Steps should be taken to prevent contact allergy epidemics. It is essential that dermatologist, scientists, administrators, and consumers organize and structure known methods to accelerate the control of emerging contact allergens.

Prenatal stress enhances susceptibility of murine adult offspring toward airway inflammation	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							PULMONARY EOSINOPHILIA; ASTHMA; CELLS; RAT; HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; PREGNANCY; CYTOKINES; ENDOTOXIN; EXPOSURE; CORTISOL	Allergic asthma is one of the most prevalent and continuously increasing diseases in developed countries. Its clinical features include airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation upon allergen contact. Furthermore, an emerging area of research subsumed as fetal programming evaluates the impact of environmental insults in utero on the incidence of diseases in later life. The aim of this study was to identify whether prenatal exposure to stress, which constitutes a severe environmental insult, perpetuates airway inflammation in later life. Our experiments were performed in mice and revealed that prenatally stressed adult offspring indeed show an increased vulnerability toward airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Furthermore, we provide persuasive insights on dysregulated pathways of the cellular and humoral immune response upon Ag challenge in prenatally stressed adult offspring, reflected by a Th2 greater Th1 adaptive immune response and increased CCR3 and IgE levels in vivo. Additionally, APCs derived from prenatally stressed offspring trigger clonal expansion of Th2 cells in vitro. We also deliver experimental evidence for a reduced corticotrophin-releasing hormone expression in the paraventricular nucleus of adult offspring in response to prenatal stress. Furthermore, behavioral analyses indicate an increase in anxiety in these mice. In conclusion, our data will facilitate future research aiming to identify the individual impact, hierarchy, and redundancy of multiple key protagonists in airway inflammation in an interdisciplinary context. This will foster the substantiation of disease-prevention strategies, such as asthma, during the prenatal period.

Current asthma and respiratory symptoms among pupils in Shanghai, China: influence of building ventilation, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and formaldehyde in classrooms	INDOOR AIR			English	Article							INDOOR AIR-QUALITY; SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT; DIFFUSION TUBES; HEALTH-SURVEY; HONG-KONG; EXPOSURE; POLLUTION; SCHOOLCHILDREN; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN	We investigated 10 naturally ventilated schools in Shanghai, in winter. Pupils (13-14 years) in 30 classes received a questionnaire, 1414 participated (99%). Classroom temperatures were 13-21 degrees C (mean 17 degrees C), relative air humidity was 36-82% (mean 56%). The air exchange rate was 2.9-29.4 ac/h (mean 9.1), because of window opening. Mean CO(2) exceeded 1000 ppm in 45% of the classrooms. NO(2) levels were 33-85 mu g/m(3) indoors, and 45-80 mu g/m(3) outdoors. Ozone were 1-9 mu g/m(3) indoors and 17-28 mu g/m(3) outdoors. In total, 8.9% had doctors' diagnosed asthma, 3.1% wheeze, 23.0% daytime breathlessness, 2.4% current asthma, and 2.3% asthma medication. Multiple logistic regression was applied. Observed indoor molds was associated with asthma attacks [odds ratio (OR) = 2.40: P < 0.05]. Indoor temperature was associated with daytime breathlessness (OR = 1.26 for 1 C; P < 0.001), and indoor CO(2) with current asthma (OR = 1.18 for 100 ppm; P < 0.01) and asthma medication (OR = 1.15 for 100 ppm; P < 0.05). Indoor NO(2) was associated with current asthma (OR = 1.51 for 10 mu g/m(3); P < 0.01) and asthma medication (OR = 1.45 for 10 mu g/m(3); P < 0.01). Outdoor NO(2) was associated with current asthma (OR = 1.44 for 10 mu g/m(3); P < 0.05). Indoor and outdoor ozone was negatively associated with daytime breathlessness. In conclusion, asthma symptoms among pupils in Shanghai can be influenced by lack of ventilation and outdoor air pollution from traffic.

BLOOD-DONORS; OCCUPATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; NURSING STAFF	Background: Natural rubber latex is a recognized allergen, but a recent meta-analysis failed to find any association between latex exposure and allergy in health care workers (HCWs). Objectives: A meta-analysis was carried out under the auspices of the French National Regulatory Authority to assess the allergic risk induced by latex gloves in HCWs. Methods: The risk of work-related exposure to latex for the development of latex allergy was assessed. Prevalence and incidence rates of latex sensitization or allergy were compared in HCWs and in the general population. Exposure-response relationships were assessed in HCWs. Results: Latex allergy was found in 4.32% (range, 4.01% to 4.63%) of HCWs and in 1.37% (range, 0.43% to 2.31%) of the general population. Latex-positive skin prick test responses ranged from 2.1% to 3.7% in the general population and from 6.9% to 7.8% for the HCWs. HCWs exposed to latex showed an increased risk of hand dermatitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.46; 95% CI, 2.11-2.86), asthma or wheezing (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.15-2.08), rhinoconjunctivitis (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.97-3.81), and at least one generic symptom (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47). Sensitization to latex was significantly associated with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis. By contrast, exposure to latex was not associated with a significantly increased risk of positive skin prick test responses to latex (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.94-2.30). Conclusion: HCWs have an increased risk of sensitization and allergic symptoms to latex. Clinical implications: Prevention of latex allergy in HCWs is needed.

Nebulisers require a power source and need regular maintenance, and are more expensive in the community setting. Objectives To assess the effects of holding chambers (spacers) compared to nebulisers for the delivery of beta 2-agonists for acute asthma. Search strategy We last searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in January 2006 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005). Selection criteria Randomised trials in adults and children (from two years of age) with asthma, where spacer beta 2-agonist delivery was compared with wet nebulisation. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently applied study inclusion criteria (one reviewer for the first version of the review), extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Missing data were obtained from the authors or estimated. Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results This review has been updated in January 2006 and four new trials have been added. 2066 children and 614 adults are now included in 25 trials from emergency room and community settings. In addition, six trials on in-patients with acute asthma (213 children and 28 adults) have been reviewed. Method of delivery of beta 2-agonist did not appear to affect hospital admission rates. In adults, the relative risk of admission for spacer versus nebuliser was 0.97 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.49). The relative risk for children was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.4 to 1.06). In children, length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used, with a mean difference of -0.47 hours (95% CI: -0.58 to -0.37). Length of stay in the emergency department for adults was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for spacer in children, mean difference -7.6% baseline (95% CI: -9.9 to -5.3% baseline). Authors' conclusions Metered-dose inhalers with spacer produced outcomes that were at least equivalent to nebuliser delivery. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma.

Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							COWS MILK ALLERGY; HIGH-RISK INFANTS; AMINO-ACID-CONCENTRATIONS; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL CHILDREN; DIETARY INTERVENTION PROGRAM; DIFFERENT FEEDING REGIMENS; PARTIAL WHEY HYDROLYSATE; BRIEF NEONATAL EXPOSURE; PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP	Background Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formula can be advocated for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without evidence of allergy or food intolerance. Objectives To determine the effect of feeding hydrolysed formulas on allergy and food intolerance in infants and children compared to adapted cow's milk or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively and partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit, including infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or prolonged formula feeding. Search strategy The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The review was updated with searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006) and CINAHL (1982 - March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's milk formula. Trials with > 80% follow up of participants were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. Main results Two trials compared early, short termhydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. No significant difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA) were reported. No eligible trial compared prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula feeding. No significant benefits were reported. One large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). Ten eligible studies compared prolonged feeding with hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula in high risk infants. Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant allergy (seven studies, 2514 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.94), but not in the incidence of childhood allergy (two studies, 950 infants; typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.05). There was no significant difference in infant eczema (eight studies, 2558 infants, typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04), childhood eczema incidence (two studies, 950 infants, typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63, 1.10), childhood eczema prevalence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43, 1.02), or infant or childhood asthma, rhinitis and food allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in infants with CMA with confirmed atopy (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.89). Subgroup analysis of trials blinded to formula found no significant difference in infant allergy (four studies, 2156 infants; typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.08) or childhood allergy incidence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73, 1.14). No eligible trial examined the effect of prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. There is evidence that preterm or low birthweight infants fed a hydrolysed preterm formula have significantly reduced weight gain, but not in other growth parameters (head circumference or length). Studies in term infants report no adverse effects on growth. Subgroup analysis of trials of partially hydrolysed versus cow's milk formula found a significant reduction in infant allergy (six studies, 1391 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) but not childhood allergy, or infant or childhood asthma, eczema or rhinitis. Methodological concerns were the same as for the overall analysis. Analysis of trials of extensively hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula found no significant differences in allergy or food intolerance. Infants fed extensively hydrolysed formula compared with partially hydrolysed formula had a significant reduction in food allergy (two studies, 341 infants; typical RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19, 0.99), but there was no significant difference in all allergy or any other specific allergy incidence. Comparing extensively hydrolysed casein containing formula with cow's milk formula, one study (431 infants) reported a significant reduction in childhood allergy incidence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53, 0.97). Meta- analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (three studies, 1237 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51, 0.97). One study reported a significant reduction in childhood eczema incidence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44, 0.98) and prevalence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.92). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of allergy compared to exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed, there is limited evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA. In view of methodological concerns and inconsistency of findings, further large, well designed trials comparing formulas containing partially hydrolysed whey, or extensively hydrolysed casein to cow's milk formulas are needed.

PREVALENCE	Background A round the globe, work has a heavy impact on health. To better advise policy makers, we assessed the global burden of disease and injury due to selected occupational hazards. This article presents an overview, and describes the methodology employed in the companion studies. Methods Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Comparative Risk Assessment methodology, we applied relative risk measures to the proportions of the population exposed to selected occupational hazards to estimate attributable fractions, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Numerous occupational risk factors had to be excluded due to inadequate global data. Results In 2000, the selected risk factors were responsible worldwide for 37% of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive. pulmonary disease (COPD), 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer, and 2% of leukemia. These risks at work caused 850, 000 deaths worldwide and resulted in the loss of about 24 million years of healthy life. Needlesticks accounted for about 40% of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infections and 4.4% of HIV infections in health care workers. Conclusions Exposure to occupational hazards accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of disease and injury, which could be substantially reduced through application of proven risk prevention strategies.

However, a secondary function of the intestinal immune system is to discriminate between pathogen-associated and 'harmless' antigens, expressing active responses against the former and tolerance to the latter. Control of immune responses appears to be an active process, involving local generation of IgA and of regulatory and/or regulated T lymphocytes. Two important periods of maximum exposure to novel antigens occur in the young animal, immediately after birth and at weaning. In both cases the antigenic composition of the intestinal contents can shift suddenly, as a result of a novel diet and of colonisation by novel strains and species of bacteria. Changes in lifestyles of man, and husbandry of animals, have resulted in weaning becoming much more abrupt than previously in evolution, increasing the number of antigens that must be simultaneously evaluated by neonates. Thus, birth and weaning are likely to represent hazard and critical control points in the development of appropriate responses to pathogens and harmless dietary and commensal antigens. Neonates are born with relatively undeveloped mucosal immune systems. At birth this factor may prevent both expression of active immune responses and development of tolerance. However, colonisation by intestinal flora expands the mucosal immune system in antigen-specific and non-specific ways. At weaning antibody to fed proteins can be detected, indicating active immune responses to fed proteins. It is proposed that under normal conditions the ability of the mucosal immune system to mount active responses to foreign antigens develops simultaneously with the ability to control and regulate such responses. Problems arise when one or other arm of the immune system develops inappropriately, resulting in inappropriate effector responses to harmless food proteins (allergy) or inadequate responses to pathogens (disease susceptibility).

Despite growing understanding of the multiple peripheral mechanisms giving rise to dyspnea, little is known about the cortical mechanisms underlying its perception. The results of neuroiniaging studies have shown that distinct brain areas process the dyspneic sensation, among which the anterior insular seems to be the most important. Based on the findings of the first relevant neuroimaging studies, this review describes the cortical structures associated with the perception of dyspnea. Moreover, similarities to the perception of pain are discussed, and implications for future research are provided.

Objective We compared the clinical efficacy of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (FPANS) 200 mug given once daily, administered in mono-therapy or combined therapy with a H-1 receptor antagonist (cetirizine, CTZ) or with a leukotriene antagonist (montelukast, MSK), and the combined therapy of CTZ plus MSK in the treatment of patients affected by allergic rhinitis to Parietaria during natural pollen exposure. In addition, we examined the effect of the treatment on eosinophil counts and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in nasal lavage performed at beginning of season, during season and at the end of the season. Methods One hundred patients aged 12-50 years (mean+/-SD 31.8+/-9.6) with a history of moderate to severe Parietaria pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis were selected. A randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo (PLA)-controlled, parallel-group study design was used. Patients were treated FPANS 200 mug once daily (n=20) or with FPANS 200 mug once daily, plus CTZ (10 mg) in the morning (n=20), or with FPANS 200 mug once daily, plus MSK (10 mg) in the evening (n=20) or with CTZ (10 mg) in the morning plus MSK in the evening (n=20) or matched PLA (n=20). Assessment of efficacy was based on scores of daily nasal symptoms and on eosinophil counts and ECP in nasal lavage. Results All treatments showed significant differences (P<0.001) compared with PLA in terms of total symptom, rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching scores. Concerning nasal congestion on waking and daily only the groups treated with FPANS in mono-therapy or in combined therapy showed significant differences compared with PLA. Comparing the group treated with FPANS alone and the groups treated with FPANS plus CTZ, we found significant differences for total symptom score (P=0.04) and for nasal itching (P=0.003). The comparison between FPANS plus CTZ and FPANS plus MSK showed significant difference for nasal itching (P=0.003). Finally, there were significant differences between the group treated with FPANS and the group treated with CTZ plus MSK for total symptom score (P=0.009), for nasal congestion on waking (P<0.001) and nasal congestion daily (P<0.001). Also the comparisons between the group treated with FPANS plus CTZ and the group treated with CTZ plus MSK demonstrated significant differences (P<0.001) for total symptom, for nasal congestion on waking and for nasal congestion on daily, for rhinorrhea (P=0.04) and for nasal itching (P=0.003) scores. Concerning the comparison between the group treated with FPANS plus MSK and the group treated with CTZ plus MSK we found significant differences for total symptom score (P=0.005), for nasal congestion on waking (P<0.001) and for nasal congestion on daily (P<0.001). No other differences were observed between the groups. Concerning blood eosinophil counts, significant differences were found between the treatments with FPANS in mono-therapy or in combined therapy with PLA group during and at the end of the season (P=0.0003 and P<0.0001, respectively). Concerning eosinophils and ECP in nasal lavage, all treatments showed significant differences (P<0.001) compared with PLA. Besides, there were significant differences (P<0.001) between the groups treated with FPANS alone or in combined therapy and the group treated with CTZ plus MSK. Conclusion The results of this comparative study demonstrate that FPANS is highly effective for treating patients affected by allergic rhinitis, with efficacy exceeding that of CTZ plus MSK in combined therapy. In addition, the regular combined therapy of FPANS plus CTZ or plus MSK would not seem to offer substantial advantage with respect to FPANS in mono-therapy in patients affected by seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Despite the increasing prevalence and socioeconomic burden, the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly defined in a large percentage of asthmatics. Animal models and, in particular, murine models of allergic airway disease have helped to reveal some of the potential underlying mechanisms and have played an important role in identifying the importance of T cells and T(H)2 cytokines in development of allergen-induced inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. In addition, other cell types including mast cells and eosinophils have been implicated in the development of some aspects of the disease. To further understand this complex syndrome, the development of animal models which mimic elements of this chronic airway disease is essential. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

This study investigated the association between household use of biomass fuels for cooking and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in preschool age children (<5 years) in Zimbabwe. Methods Analysis is based on 3559 children age 0-59 months included in the 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). Children who suffered from cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing during the 2 weeks preceding the survey were defined as having suffered from ARI. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of suffering from ARI among children from households using biomass fuels (wood, dung, or straw) relative to children from households using cleaner fuels (liquid petroleum gas [LPG]/natural gas, or electricity), after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Results About two-thirds (66%) of children lived in households using biomass fuels and 16% suffered from ARI during the 2 weeks preceding the survey interview. After adjusting for child's age, sex, birth order, nutritional status, mother's age at childbirth, education, religion, household living standard, and region of residence, children in households using wood, dung, or straw for cooking were more than twice as likely to have suffered from ARI as children from households using LPG/natural gas or electricity (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.19). Conclusions Household use of high pollution biomass fuels is associated with ARI in children in Zimbabwe. The relationship needs to be further investigated using more direct measures of smoke exposure and clinical measures of ARI.

Objective The allergenic properties of tropomyosin (muscle-derived protein) have been recently demonstrated in invertebrates such as cockroaches, dust mites, and shrimp. In view of a possible cross-reactivity between food allergens and related allergens from animal sources, we designed a study to assess IgE antibody reactivity to the major shrimp allergen, Pen a 1, in an unexposed population of Orthodox Jews, who observe Kosher dietary laws that prohibit eating shellfish. Methods Nine subjects, who reacted positively by skin tests to shrimp (Penaeus setiferous ), were selected for the study. Subjects (two females, seven males) ranged in age from 14 to 32 years (mean 20.4). All subjects were strictly observant of Jewish tradition and had no prior exposure to seafood (regarded as a non-Kosher food). Serum was obtained from all the subjects and tested for IgE antibody reactivity to shrimp and dust mite. Results All subjects reported symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis, five had history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and/or sinusitis. All had positive skin prick tests to shrimp and house dust mite (HDM) (Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus , or both); 2/7 subjects were positive to cockroach mix (Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana ). Sera of 4/9 subjects demonstrated specific IgE antibodies by RAST to shrimp (7.0-20.0%), 3/9 to Pen a 1 (6.3-24.1%), and 3/9 to shrimp or Pen a 1 by immunoblot. IgE binding to Pen a 1 was inhibited with either mite or cockroach extracts as demonstrated by RAST and/or immunoblot inhibition analysis. Conclusions These studies indicate that IgE antibody reactivity to a major food allergen, shrimp, can occur in an unexposed population of individuals; some subjects allergic to HDM and/or cockroach show substantial IgE antibody reactivity to the major shrimp allergen Pen a 1 (tropomyosin). Based on inhibition with cockroach and/or dust mite extracts, this reactivity appears to be due to cross-reacting tropomyosins.

A 7-member panel representing specialists in dermatology, allergy, asthma, immunology, and pediatrics from around the United States convened to review the current literature and evolving data on AD. Participants presented reviews to the panel on the epidemiology of asthma and AD, the genetic predisposition to allergic disease, the current understanding of the immunopathophysiology of AD, interrelationships between the pathologic pathways of asthma and AD, evolving treatment concepts and options in AD, and the applicability of the asthma treatment model and how it may be adapted for guideline development for AD. Commentary and criticism were recorded for use in document preparation. Results. There are clear epidemiologic parallels in asthma and AD. Importantly, AD frequently is the first manifestation of an atopic diathesis, which occurs in genetically predisposed individuals and also includes asthma and allergic rhinitis. Up to 80% of children with AD will eventually develop allergic rhinitis or asthma later in childhood. This classic "atopic triad" has numerous pathophysiologic elements in common, including cyclic nucleotide regulatory abnormalities, immune cell alterations, and inflammatory mediators and allergic triggers. New therapeutic options that target underlying immune mechanisms are available, and their place among treatments for AD is becoming established. Guidelines of care have been developed for asthma. The panel noted that the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines for diagnosis and management of asthma, first issued in 1991, had a tremendous positive impact on many aspects of asthma treatment. It not only created a heightened awareness that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation, but it also provided unified approaches for therapy and opened new areas of basic science and clinical research. In addition, the guidelines spurred interactions among physicians of various specialties and stimulated a great quantity of research in asthma therapy. It is anticipated that AD therapy guidelines would have similar positive outcomes. Conclusions. The panel concluded that, on the basis of current information and evolving therapeutic options, a clear rationale exists to support AD guideline development. The many parallels between AD and asthma suggest that processes and approaches used for the asthma therapy guidelines would be appropriate for AD.

Distal lung inflammation can be observed even In patients with asthma with mild disease and normal spirometric readings. Subjects with asymptomatic asthma can exhibit significant Increases In peripheral airway resistance, likely the result of distal lung inflammation. As determined from measurements of eosinophilic and other cellular infiltrates, the inflammatory response in the distal lung can exceed that in the large airways. Nocturnal asthma, a natural model of cyclic asthma worsening, is associated with an increase in nighttime distal lung inflammation, as evidenced by the accumulation of alveolar tissue eosinophils. Distal lung disease appears to Increase the risk of recurrent asthma exacerbation, whereas disease-related anatomic changes in the small airways of the distal lung are prominent in fatal asthma. The clinical significance of distal lung disease makes this region an important therapeutic target. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based preparations of inhaled corticosteroids used to treat airway inflammation produce aerosols of relatively large particle size (similar to4 mum); such aerosols have poor access to the distal lung. New formulations of Inhaled corticosteroids that use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants can have smaller particle sizes (similar to1 mum). Extrafine HFA aerosols have better access to the distal lung, with less oropharyngeal deposition. Imaging studies suggest that anti-inflammatory medication delivered as an extrafine aerosol produces beneficial changes in distal lung function. In one study, an HFA formulation of an inhaled corticosteroid reduced air trapping to a greater degree than a CFC formulation of the same corticosteroid. By extending the delivery of anti-inflammatory medication to the distal lung, the new HFA-based corticosteroids have the potential to treat asthma more effectively and at reduced steroid doses.

Materials and methods: BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OA), and exposed to aerosolized OA (0.01, 0.1 and 1%). Twenty-four hours after the final antigen challenge, bronchial responsiveness was measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histological examinations were carried out. Results: Repeated antigen exposure induced airway inflammation, IgE/IgG1 responses, epithelial changes, collagen deposition in the lungs, subepithelial fibrosis associated with increases in the amount of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in BAL fluid (BALF), and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine. The number of eosinophils in BALF was significantly correlated with TGF-beta1 production in BALF and the amount of hydroxyproline. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between these fibrogenic parameters and the bronchial responsiveness.

To investigate the effects of real-world PM exposure on airway reactivity (AHR) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity, we exposed naive mice to a single dose (0.5 mg/ mouse) of ambient PM, coal fly ash, or diesel PM. We found that ambient PM exposure induced increases in AHR and BAL cellularity, whereas diesel PM induced significant increases in BAL cellularity, but not AHR. On the other hand, coal fly ash exposure did not elicit significant changes in either of these parameters. We further examined ambient PM-induced temporal changes in AHR, BAL cells, and lung cytakine levels over a 2-wk period. Ambient PM-induced AHR was sustained over 7 d. The increase in AHR was preceded by dramatic increases in BAL eosinophils, whereas a decline in AHR was associated with increases. in macrophages. A Th2 cytokine pattern (IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin) was observed early on with a shift toward a Th1 pattern (IFN-gamma). In additional studies, we found that the active component(s) of ambient PM are not water-soluble and that ambient PM-induced AHR and inflammation are dose-dependent. We conclude that ambient PM can induce asthmalike parameters in naive mice, suggesting that PM exposure may be an important factor in increases in asthma prevalence.

Two types of occupational asthma (OA) are distinguished by whether they arise after a latency period that is necessary for acquiring sensitization or as a result of acute exposure to irritant materials (irritant-induced asthma). The pathophysiology of OA with a latency period is similar to that of nonoccupational asthma, whereas the mechanism of irritant-induced asthma is still uncertain. HLA haplotypes and other genetic polymorphisms have been found to be associated with OA. According to various sources of data, the overall frequency of OA has remained stable in the last 10 years, although the frequency of causal agents vary. Registers of causal occupations and agents have been issued on Web sites (eg, www.asmanet.com). Improved sampling methods have shown that the degree of exposure plays a key role in the onset of the disease, whereas prospective data collected in high-risk workplaces have also identified personal risk factors (eg, atopy, smoking, and rhinoconjunctivitis). A diagnosis of OA should no longer be based on a compatible history only but should be confirmed by means of objective testing. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the worker should be removed from exposure, and satisfactory compensation programs should be offered, the most important being retraining programs with financial compensations because affected workers are generally young. The cost-effectiveness of prevention programs in high-risk workforces should be assessed.

Ascospores generally follow precipitation, while spore types such as Atternaria and Cladosporium are abundant in dry conditions. This project attempted to correlate fungal spore concentrations with meteorological data from Tulsa, Oklahoma during May 1998 and May 1999, Air samples were collected and analyzed by the 12-traverse method. The spore types included were Cladosporium, Alternaria, Epicoccum, Curvularia, Pithomyces, Drechslera. smut spores, ascospores, basidiospores, and other spores. Weather variables included precipitation levels, temperature, dew point, air pressure. wind speed, wind direction and wind gusts. There were over 242.57 mm of rainfall in May 1999 and only 64.01 mm in May 1998. The most abundant spore types during May 1998 and May 1999 were Cladosporium, ascospores, and basidiospores. Results showed that there were significant differences in the dry-air spora between May 1998 and May 1999. There were twice as many Cladosporium in May 1998 as in May 1999; both ascospores and basidiospores showed little change. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which meteorological variables influenced spore concentrations. Results showed that there was no single model for all spore types.

Methods: A cohort of 300 new employees, without previous occupational exposure to flour, were followed prospectively for a median (range) of 40 (1-91) months. Cases-defined as those developing work-related symptoms or a positive skin prick test to hour or alpha -amylase during follow up-were compared with controls, matched for duration of employment. Exposures to hour aeroallergen and total inhalable dust were estimated using a questionnaire and personal sampling techniques. Results: Incidence rates for work-related eye/nose and chest symptoms were 11.8 and 4.1 cases per 100 person years (py), respectively. Few er employees developed positive skin prick tests to hour (2.2 cases per 100 py) or alpha -amylase (2.5 cases per 100 py), Positive skin tests to occupational allergens were more common among those with new work-related symptoms. There were clear relationships between the risks of developing work-related symptoms or a positive skin prick test and three categories of estimated exposure to total dust or hour aeroallergen. Atopic employees were more likely to develop a positive skin prick test-but not work-related symptoms, These findings were unaffected by age, sex or cigarette smoking. Conclusions: In this population, many work-related symptoms which develop after first employment in modern UK bakeries or hour mills were not accompanied by evidence of IgE sensitization to flour or alpha -amylase, Although average dust exposures were within current occupational standards, the risks of development of upper and lower respiratory symptoms and of specific sensitization were clearly related to total dust and/or flour aeroallergen exposure. The incidence of work-related chest symptoms in the presence of a positive skin test to flour or alpha -amylase in this setting was approximately 1 case per 100 py, (C) 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

Rats received i.v. transfers of syngeneic allergen-specific Th1 or Th2 cells, 24 h before aerosol exposure to allergen, and were studied 18-24 h later. Adoptive transfer of OVA-specific Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells, and OVA, but not BSA exposure, induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to acetylcholine and eosinophilia in a cell number-dependent manner. Importantly, cotransfer of OVA-specific Th1 cells dose-dependently reversed BHR and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophilia, but not mucosal eosinophilia, OVA-specific Th1 cells transferred alone induced mucosal eosinophilia, but neither BHR nor BAL eosinophilia. Th1 suppression of BHR and BAL eosinophilia was allergen specific, since cotransfer of BSA-specific Th1 cells with the OVA-specific Th2 cells was not inhibitory when OVA aerosol alone was used, but was suppressive with OVA and BSA challenge, Furthermore, recipients of Th1 cells alone had increased gene expression for IFN-gamma in the Lungs, while those receiving Th2 cells alone showed increased IL-4 mRNA, Importantly, induction of these Th2 cytokines was inhibited in recipients of combined Th1 and Th2 tells. Anti-IFN-gamma treatment attenuated the down-regulatory effect of Th1 cells. Allergen-specific Th1 cells down-regulate efferent Th2 cytokine-dependent BHR and BAL eosinophilia in an asthma model via mechanisms that depend on IFN-gamma, Therapy designed to control the efferent phase of established asthma by augmenting down-regulatory Th1 counterbalancing mechanisms should be effective.

We report an outbreak of asthma, at least equal in sire to those reported in the 1960s, in a modern European factory which has exclusively used encapsulated enzymes. A survey revealed that enzyme sensitisation and work-related respiratory symptoms were positively correlated with airborne enzyme exposure. We suggest that encapsulation alone is insufficient to prevent enzyme-induced allergy and asthma.

The results of several studies provide strong evidence in support of a role for allergen avoidance; however, strategies that optimize allergen reduction in houses have not been determined. Complex issues regarding the efficacy of physical and chemical measures that target house dust mite, pet, and cockroach allergens in the home are discussed. The greatest challenge is to educate allergic patients so that they can play an important role in controlling their own disease.

In a recent bronchoscopic study in healthy volunteers, pronounced airway inflammation was detected following exposure to diesel exhaust (DE), The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the time kinetics of the inflammatory response following exposure to DE using induced sputum from healthy volunteers. Fifteen healthy nonsmoking volunteers were exposed to DE particles,vith a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m 300 mu g.m(-3) and air for 1 h on two separate occasions. Sputum induction with hypertonic saline was performed 6 and 24 h after each exposure. Analyses of sputum differential cell counts and soluble protein concentrations were performed. Six hours after exposure to DE, a significant increase was found in the percentage of sputum neutrophils (37.7 versus 26.2% p=0.002) together with increases in the concentrations of interleukin-6 (12.0 versus 6.3 pg.mL(-1), p=0.006) and methylhistamine (0.11 versus 0.12 mu g.L-1, p=0.024). Irrespective of exposure, a significant increase was found in the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 24 as compared to 6 h. indicating that the procedure of sputum induction itself may change the composition of sputum. This study demonstrates that exposure to diesel exhaust induces inflammatory response in healthy human airways, represented by an early increase in interleukin-6 and methylhistamine concentration and the percentage of neutrophils. Induced sputum provides a safe tool for the investigation of the inflammatory effects of diesel exhaust, but care must be taken when interpreting results from repeated sputum inductions.

Here we examined skin surface pH, stratum corneum hydration, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin roughness by profilometry in a study population comprising 377 primary school children (8-9 years old) as part of a multicentre survey on risk factors for allergic diseases in school children. Skin surface pH showed significant higher values (p=0.029) in the group with atopic eczema (n=45) compared with the group without atopic eczema; all other parameters did not differ significantly between children,vith and without atopic eczema. With increasing skin dryness there was a significant increase in pH values (p = 0.004). Stratum corneum hydration showed a significant decrease with increasing dryness (p<0.001). Measurement of skin roughness also revealed a significant linear relationship with skin dryness (p = 0.02). It is concluded that measurement of skin surface pH, corneometry and profilometry are useful non-invasive techniques to objectively assess skin dryness in epidemiological studies regarding atopic skin disease.

Association of Antibiotics in Infancy With Early Childhood Obesity	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							INFECTIOUS-DISEASES SOCIETY; GUT MICROBIOME; OTITIS-MEDIA; BODY-MASS; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; DIAGNOSIS; AMERICA	IMPORTANCE Obesity in children and adults is associated with significant health burdens, making prevention a public health imperative. Infancy may be a critical period when environmental factors exert a lasting effect on the risk for obesity; identifying modifiable factors may help to reduce this risk. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of antibiotics prescribed in infancy (ages 0-23 months) on obesity in early childhood (ages 24-59 months). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a cohort study spanning 2001-2013 using electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard models were used to adjust for demographic, practice, and clinical covariates. The study spanned a network of primary care practices affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia including both teaching clinics and private practices in urban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding region. All children with annual visits at ages 0 to 23 months, as well 1 or more visits at ages 24 to 59 months, were enrolled. The cohort comprised 64 580 children. EXPOSURES Treatment episodes for prescribed antibiotics were ascertained up to 23 months of age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Obesity outcomes were determined directly from anthropometric measurements using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2000 body mass index norms. RESULTS Sixty-nine percent of children were exposed to antibiotics before age 24 months, with a mean (SD) of 2.3 (1.5) episodes per child. Cumulative exposure to antibiotics was associated with later obesity (rate ratio [RR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21 for >= 4 episodes); this effect was stronger for broad-spectrum antibiotics (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29). Early exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics was also associated with obesity (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19 at 0-5 months of age and RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14 at 6-11 months of age) but narrow-spectrum drugs were not at any age or frequency. Steroid use, male sex, urban practice, public insurance, Hispanic ethnicity, and diagnosed asthma or wheezing were also predictors of obesity; common infectious diagnoses and antireflux medications were not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Repeated exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics at ages 0 to 23 months is associated with early childhood obesity. Because common childhood infections were the most frequent diagnoses co-occurring with broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription, narrowing antibiotic selection is potentially a modifiable risk factor for childhood obesity.

A genome-wide association meta-analysis of self-reported allergy identifies shared and allergy-specific susceptibility loci	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; GENOTYPE DATA; RISK LOCI; T-CELLS; ASTHMA; POPULATION; VARIANTS; GENE; DIFFERENTIATION	Allergic disease is very common and carries substantial public-health burdens. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide associations with self-reported cat, dust-mite and pollen allergies in 53,862 individuals. We used generalized estimating equations to model shared and allergy-specific genetic effects. We identified 16 shared susceptibility loci with association P < 5 x 10(-8), including 8 loci previously associated with asthma, as well as 4p14 near TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 (rs2101521, P = 5.3 x 10(-21)); 6p21.33 near HLA-C and MICA (rs9266772, P = 3.2 x 10(-12)); 5p13.1 near PTGER4 (rs7720838, P = 8.2 x 10(-11)); 2q33.1 in PLCL1 (rs10497813, P = 6.1 x 10(-10)), 3q28 in LPP (rs9860547, P = 1.2 x 10(-9)); 20q13.2 in NFATC2 (rs6021270, P = 6.9 x 10(-9)), 4q27 in ADAD1 (rs17388568, P = 3.9 x 10(-8)); and 14q21.1 near FOXA1 and TTC6 (rs1998359, P = 4.8 x 10(-8)). We identified one locus with substantial evidence of differences in effects across allergies at 6p21.32 in the class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs17533090, P = 1.7 x 10(-12)), which was strongly associated with cat allergy. Our study sheds new light on the shared etiology of immune and autoimmune disease.

Although the prevalence remains to be established, a number of patients previously given a diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis or idiopathic rhinitis are now being classified as having LAR. Culprit allergens responsible include house dust mite, grass and olive pollens, and many others. For the diagnosis of LAR, neither skin prick testing nor determination of the presence of serum sIgE antibodies is useful, and a nasal allergen provocation test is needed to identify the culprit allergen or allergens. In a certain proportion of cases, local sIgE can be detected, and conjunctivitis, asthma, or both can be associated. Whether patients with LAR will have systemic atopy in the future is a matter of debate. Further studies are needed for examine the prevalence of this phenomenon in different areas, to improve the diagnostic methods to better identify these patients, and to develop therapeutic approaches, including the use of immunotherapy.

The Mannose Receptor Mediates the Uptake of Diverse Native Allergens by Dendritic Cells and Determines Allergen-Induced T Cell Polarization through Modulation of IDO Activity	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE IDO; TRYPTOPHAN-METABOLITES; ANTIGEN PRESENTATION; EXPERIMENTAL ASTHMA; TH2 POLARIZATION; IL-4 PRODUCTION; RESPONSES; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION; MATURATION	The mannose receptor (MR) is a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells (DCs). We have investigated the ability of MR to recognize glycosylated allergens. Using a gene silencing strategy, we have specifically inhibited the expression of MR on human monocyte-derived DCs. We show that MR mediates internalization of diverse allergens from mite (Der p 1 and Der p 2), dog (Can f 1), cockroach (Bla g 2), and peanut (Ara h 1) through their carbohydrate moieties. All of these allergens bind to the C-type lectin-like carbohydrate recognition domains 4-7 of MR. We have also assessed the contribution of MR to T cell polarization after allergen exposure. We show that silencing MR expression on monocyte-derived DCs reverses the Th2 cell polarization bias, driven by Der p 1 allergen exposure, through upregulation of IDO activity. In conclusion, our work demonstrates a major role for MR in glycoallergen recognition and in the development of Th2 responses. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 1522-1531.

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of allergy in patients with respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma and/or rhinitis attending respiratory clinics within mainland China. The study also investigated regional and annual differences in the prevalence and pattern of sensitization among the patients in China. A cross-sectional survey was performed in 6304 patients suffering from asthma and/or rhinitis in 17 cities from 4 regions of China. Patients completed a standardized questionnaire asking for the presence of respiratory and allergic symptoms. They also underwent skin prick tests with 13 common aeroallergens. Among the 6304 patients, 4545 (72.1%) had at least one positive skin prick reaction. The overall prevalence of positive skin prick responses was 59.0% for Dermatophagoides farinae, 57.6% for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 40.7% for Blomia tropicalis, 16.1% for American cockroach, 14.0% for dog, 11.5% for Blatella germanica, 11.3% for Artemisia vulgaris, 10.3% for cat, 6.5% for Ambrosia artemisifolia, 6.3% for mixed mould I, 4.4% for mixed mould IV, 3.5% for mixed grass pollen and 2.2% for mixed tree pollen. Sensitizations to common allergens varied widely between geographical areas and demonstrated unique pattern in patients by stratification with age groups, with asthma and/or rhinitis. Severity of rhinitis and asthma was significantly correlated with skin index of reactivity to Artemisia vulgaris, Ambrosia artemisifolia and to D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae and Blomia tropicalis respectively (P < 0.001). Positive reactivity to the tested allergens and concomitant reactivity to multiple allergens including to house dust mites and Blomia tropicalis was markedly increased in patients with both asthma and rhinitis. House dust mites were the most prevalent allergens in patients with asthma and/or rhinitis in China. There were significant differences in patterns of sensitizations in patients from different geographical areas, age groups as well as asthma and/or rhinitis.

This uneven burden in asthma morbidity has been ever increasing despite medical advancement. Many factors have contributed to these disparities in the areas of health care inequities, which result in inadequate treatment; poor housing, which leads to increased exposure to asthma allergens; and social and psychosocial stressors, which are often unappreciated. Interventions to reduce individual areas of disparities have had varying successes. Because asthma is a complex disease that affects millions of persons, multifaceted comprehensive interventions that combine all evidence-based successful strategies are essential to finally closing the gap in asthma morbidity.

Exacerbation of skin infections has been proposed as a further consequence of UV-induced immunosuppression. Clinically bacterial infections are not a problem. For defense against bacteria, the innate immune response including the release of antimicrobial peptides is much more relevant than the adaptive immune response. Keratinocytes; have the capacity to release antimicrobial peptides. Objective: We asked whether UV radiation induces antimicrobial peptides in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Antimicrobial peptide expression by normal human keratinocytes was measured by real-time PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Biopsies taken from human volunteers and skin explants were studied with immunohistochemistry. Results: Real-time PCR of normal human keratinocytes revealed a dose-dependent increase of human beta-defensin-2, -3, ribonuclease 7, and psoriasin (S100A7) after UV radiation. This was confirmed at the protein level by intracellular fluorescence-activated cell sorting and in vitro immunofluorescence analysis. Immunohistochemistry of biopsies taken from healthy volunteers exposed to different UV radiation doses revealed enhanced epidermal expression of antimicrobial peptides after UV exposure. This was also confirmed by exposing human skin explants to UV radiation. Conclusion: UV radiation exerts diverse effects on the immune system, suppressing the adaptive but inducing the innate immune response. This may explain why T-cell-mediated immune reactions are suppressed on UV exposure but not host defense reactions against bacterial attacks. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;123:1117-23.)

Like nonoccupational asthma, occupational asthma is probably the result of multiple genetic, environmental, and behavioral influences. It is important that occupational asthma be recognized clinically because it has serious medical and socioeconomic consequences. Environmental factors that can affect the initiation of occupational asthma include the intrinsic characteristics of causative agents as well as the influence of the level and route of exposure at the workplace. The identification of host factors, polymorphisms, and candidate genes associated with occupational asthma may improve our understanding of mechanisms involved in asthma. High-molecular-weight compounds from biological sources and low-molecular-weight chemicals cause occupational asthma after a latent period of exposure. Although the clinical, functional, and pathologic features of occupational asthma caused by low-molecular-weight agents resemble those of allergic asthma, the failure to detect specific IgE antibodies against most low-molecular-weight agents has resulted in a search for alternative or complementary physiopathologic mechanisms leading to airway sensitization. Recent advances have been made in the characterization of the immune response to low-molecular-weight agents. In contrast, the mechanism of the type of occupational asthma that occurs without latency after high-level exposure to irritants remains undetermined. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;123:531-42.)

Our aim was to determine the frequencies of IgE reactivity to purified HDM allergen molecules in mite allergic patients from different parts of Europe in order to establish an allergen panel for diagnosis of HDM allergy. Populations of D. pteronyssinus-allergic patients from Austria (n = 56), France (n = 55), Italy (n = 67) and Sweden (n = 65) and storage mite allergic patients from Sweden (n = 31) were analysed for IgE reactivity to eight purified natural (n) and recombinant (r) D. pteronyssinus allergens (nDer p 1, rDer p 2, nDer p 4, rDer p 5, rDer p 7, rDer p 8, rDer p 10 and rDer p 14) in RAST-based dot blot assays. Using a combination of Der p 1 and Der p 2, at least 97% of the D. pteronyssinus-allergic patients could be diagnosed in each of the HDM allergic populations. However, more than 50% of the patients also reacted with other allergens and significant variabilities regarding the frequencies of IgE reactivity to individual allergen molecules were found. Patients with a predominant storage mite allergy showed none or only very weak IgE reactivity to purified D. pteronyssinus allergens. Purified Der p 1 and Der p 2 are sufficient for the diagnosis of >= 97% of D. pteronyssinus allergic patients in Europe, but other allergens may also play an important role for the diagnosis and treatment of HDM allergy.

TH2-cytokines increase the production of IgE and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas T(H)1-cytokines, Such Lis IFN-gamma, may suppress IgE synthesis and Stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of IgA. Thus, a dysregulation In the expression of T(H)1- and T(H)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. Lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal rnicroflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate T(H)1/T(H)2 responses. The mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. We Sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus gasseri (PA 16/8) Bifidobacterium bifidum (MP20/5), and B Bifidobacterium longum (SP07/3), on the T(H)1 I and T(H)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt). To elucidate the Molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic DNA were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. PBMCs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48h, respectively, With Or Without SEA and Dpt allergens. The effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic DNA, Lidded Simultaneously to Cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring T(H)1/T(H)2-cytokine production. The tested live Gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic DNA inhibited SEA- and Dpt-stimulated secretion of T(H)2-cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) and enhanced the Stimulation of IFN-gamma. This effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) tested (10 bacteria per (PBMC) and their DNA (75 ng/rnl). Based on the maximal effects achieved with LAB and their DNA, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by DNA. No significant effect was induced by the control, Gram-negative Escherichia coli TGl. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced SEA-stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 production more effectively in PBMCs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. In contrast to this, inhibition of Dpt-stimulated IL-4- and IL-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. Compared with living LAB, bacterial DNA inhibited IL-4- and IL-5-secretion in a similar manner. SEA- and even more so Dpt-stimulated IFN-gamma stimulation by living LAB was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy Subjects, whereas IFN-gamma Stimulation by their DNA was more Pronounced in allergic subjects. The tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic DNA modulated the T(H)1/T(H)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. DNA seems to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. The magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. Whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed In clinical trials. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

PARTICULATE MATTER; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; INFANT-MORTALITY	Children seem to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects of ambient air air pollution; pollutants because their defence mechanisms are still evolving and because they inhale a particulate matter; higher volume of air per body weight than adults. Air pollutants can also harm the foetus if nitrogen oxides; the mother is exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy. An increase in oxidative stress respiratory neonatal mortality has been associated with ambient levels of air pollutants. Exposure to fine particles has been shown to increase allergen sensitisation, increase the risk of worsening asthma and decrease lung function. Lung growth, as measured by lung function, seems to be adversely affected in children exposed to various oxidant air pollutants. Oxidative stress is the main underlying mechanism responsible for the harmful effects of air pollutants and preliminary studies have indicated that antioxicant supplementation can offer some protection.

This review evaluates whether the major groups of indoor chemical exposures possess allergy-promoting (adjuvant) effects; formaldehyde was excluded, because of the size of the literature. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used as an example of gases and vapors. The precipitation of asthmatic symptoms by VOC exposures is probably because of VOC levels considerably above typical indoor levels, or VOCs may be a surrogate for exposure to allergens, combustion products or dampness. Indoor particles possessed adjuvant effects in animal studies and allergy-promoting effects in humans. Quaternary ammonium compounds may possess adjuvant effects in animal studies and promoted sensitization in humans in occupational settings. The use of cleaning agents, anionic and non-ionic surfactants are not considered to possess an important adjuvant effect in the general population. Regarding phthalate exposures, results from animal and epidemiological studies were found to be discordant. There is little evidence that the indoor chemicals evaluated possess important adjuvant effects. If buildings are kept clean, dry and free of combustion products, the important question may be would it be profitable to look for lifestyle factors and non-chemical indoor exposures in order to abate airway allergy?

Internet-based home monitoring and education of children with asthma is comparable to ideal office-based care: Results of a 1-year asthma in-home monitoring trial	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						telemedicine; home; telehealth; telemonitoring; store-and-forward; clinic; case management; pediatric	METERED-DOSE INHALER; MANAGEMENT; TELEMEDICINE; IMPROVEMENT; PREVENTION; DEPOSITION; QUALITY; THERAPY; PROGRAM	OBJECTIVE. The goal was to determine whether home asthma telemonitoring with store- and- forward technology improved outcomes, compared with in- person, office- based visits. METHODS. A total of 120 patients, 6 to 17 years of age, with persistent asthma were assigned randomly to the office- based or virtual group. The 2 groups followed the same ambulatory clinical pathway for 12 months. Office- based group patients received traditional in- person education and case management. Virtual group patients received computers, Internet connections, and in- home, Internet- based case management and received education through the study Web site. Disease control outcome measures included quality of life, utilization of services, and symptom control. RESULTS. A total of 120 volunteers ( 45 female) were enrolled. The groups were clinically comparable ( office- based: 22 female/ 38 male; mean age: 9.0 +/- 3.0 years; virtual: 23 female/ 37 male; mean age: 10.2 +/- 3.1 years). Virtual patients had higher metered- dose inhaler with valved holding chamber technique scores than did the office- based group at 52 weeks ( 94% vs 89%), had greater adherence to daily asthma symptom diary submission ( 35.4% vs 20.8%), had less participant time ( 636 vs 713 patient- months), and were older. Caregivers in both groups perceived an increase in quality of life and an increase in asthma knowledge scores from baseline. There were no other differences in therapeutic or disease control outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS. Virtual group patients achieved excellent asthma therapeutic and disease control outcomes. Compared with those who received standardized officebased care, they were more adherent to diary submission and had better inhaler scores at 52 weeks. Store- and- forward telemedicine technology and case management provide additional tools to assist in the management of children with persistent asthma.

Methods A multicentre case-control study was conducted in Guinee, Guinea Bissau, and The Gambia, from January 1999 to March 2001. Cases were newly detected smear positive TB patients. TWO controls were recruited for each case, one within the household of the case, and one in the community. Results Regarding host-related factors, univariate analysis by conditional logistic regression of 687 matched pairs of cases and household controls showed that TB was associated with male sex, family history of TB, absence of a BCG scar, smoking, alcohol, anaemia, HIV infection, and history and treatment of worm infection. In a multivariable model based on 601 matched pairs, male sex, family history of TB, smoking, and HIV infection were independent risk factors of TB. The investigation of environmental factors based on the comparison of 816 cases/community control pairs showed that the risk of TB was associated with single marital status, family history of TB, adult crowding, and renting the house. In a final model assessing the combined effect of host and environmental factors, TB was associated with male sex, HIV infection, smoking (with a dose-effect relationship), history of asthma, family history of TB, marital status, adult crowding, and renting the house. Conclusion TB is a multifactorial disorder, in which environment interacts with host-related factors. This study provided useful information for the assessment of host and environmental factors of TB for the improvement of TB control activities in developing countries.

The notion that TNF-alpha is released in allergic responses from both mast cells and macrophages via IgE-dependent mechanisms, the demonstration that elevated levels of TNF-a are frequently observed in bronchoalveolar fluid of asthmatic subjects undergoing allergen challenge and the results from exposure studies of TNF-alpha in vivo showing increases in airway responsiveness in both normal and asthmatic subjects emphasize the importance of TNF-alpha in the initiation of allergic asthmatic airway inflammation and the generation of airway hyper-responsiveness. Drugs targeting TNF-alpha have been developed to neutralize the deleterious effects of this inflammatory cytokine and have proved to be safe and effective in the treatment of patients with RA, Crohn's disease and psoriasis refractory to conventional treatments. Biological therapies blocking TNF-alpha are likely to constitute a considerable advance in the management of those difficult cases of asthma that are particularly resistant to typical treatment modalities. In this review article, we intend to address the potential role of TNF-alpha in asthma and to put forward the idea that drugs that have been developed to neutralize the deleterious effects of TNF-alpha may also be useful in the management of chronic severe asthma.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a common cause of hospitalizations in children and has been increasingly identified as a risk factor in the development of asthma. Little is known about what determines the severity of RSV bronchiolitis, which may be helpful in the initial assessment of these children. Design. We evaluated a variety of environmental and host factors that may contribute to the severity of RSV bronchiolitis in the RSV Bronchiolitis in Early Life prospective cohort study. Severity of bronchiolitis was based on the quantization of lowest O-2 saturation and the length of stay. These factors included the child's and family's demographics, presence of household allergens (dust mite, cat, dog, and cockroach), peripheral blood eosinophil count, immunoglobulin E level, infant feeding, prior illnesses, exposure to intrauterine and postnatal cigarette smoke, and family history of atopy. Patients. We prospectively enrolled 206 hospitalized infants, all under 12 months old (4.0 +/- 3.3 months old), with their first episode of severe RSV bronchiolitis (mean O-2 saturation: 91.6 +/- 7.3%; length of stay: 2.5 +/- 2.5 days; presence of radiographic opacities: 75%). Patients were excluded for a variety of reasons including previous wheezing, regular use of bronchodilator or antiinflammatory medications, any preexisting lung disease including asthma, chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or cystic fibrosis; gastroesophageal reflux disease on medical therapy; or congenital anomalies of the chest or lung. Results. Age was found to be a significant factor in the severity of infection. The younger an infant was, the more severe the infection tended to be as measured by the lowest oxygen (O-2) saturation. We also found that infants exposed to postnatal cigarette smoke from the mother had a lower O-2 saturation than those not exposed. However, there was no significant difference in RSV bronchiolitis severity between infants exposed only to intrauterine smoke and those infants never exposed to cigarette smoke. Infants with a family history of atopy, especially a maternal history of asthma or hay fever, had a higher O-2 saturation. Although a history of maternal atopy seemed to be protective, there was no association between allergens and bronchiolitis severity, although 25% of households had elevated allergen levels. Black infants demonstrated less severe RSV bronchiolitis than their white counterparts. Multivariate analysis revealed age, race, maternal atopy, and smoking to be associated with severity of RSV bronchiolitis. Conclusion. The severity of RSV bronchiolitis early in life seems modified by postnatal maternal cigarette smoke exposure and atopy and age of the infant, not by levels of allergens in the home environment.

However, limited data on its efficacy is available. Methods: In four German centres 97 children (age 3-14 years) with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to grass pollen were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind trial comparing SLIT (Pangramin SLIT(R); ALK-SCHERAX, 0.5 mug major allergens, three times per week, 32 months) with placebo. Primary endpoint was a multiple symptom-medication score for changes in seasonal diary entries between the first and third year of the study (SLIT n = 39; placebo n = 38). Results: The multiple symptom-medication score was significantly reduced by SLIT to 77.3% of the placebo group (P = 0.0498). The subsequent analysis of the single endpoints did not reveal significant differences for symptom scores in favour of SLIT (85.1% of placebo group; P = 0.22). However, the medication score improved significantly (67.1% of placebo group; P = 0.0025). Furthermore, secondary endpoints assessing in vivo immune responses did not differ significantly between the groups. However, retrospective analysis showed some inhomogeneity for clinical and in vitro parameters at the beginning of the study. Allergic side effects with possible relation to the study drug were reported in both groups (SLIT 49%, placebo 27%, P = 0.026). Conclusion: Our study indicates that SLIT had a positive effect on the reduction of a multiple symptom-medication score, mainly by significantly reducing rescue medication use, but had no significant effect on symptoms alone in children with rhinoconjunctivitis to grass pollen compared with a placebo.

Growing scientific evidence has shown that because people generally spend the majority of their time indoors, indoor pollution plays a significant role in affecting health and is thus an important health issue. Indoor environments include dwellings, workplaces, schools and day care centres, bars, discotheques and vehicles. Common indoor pollutants are environmental tobacco smoke, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and biological allergens. In developing countries, relevant sources of indoor pollution include biomass and coal burning for cooking and heating. Concentrations of these pollutants can be many times higher indoors than outdoors. Indoor air pollution may increase the risk of irritation phenomena, allergic sensitisation, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and lung function impairment. Recent conservative estimates have shown that 1.5-2 million deaths per year worldwide could be attributed to indoor air pollution. Approximately I million of these deaths occur in children aged tinder 5 years due to acute respiratory infections and significant proportions of deaths occur due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in women. Today, indoor air pollution ranks tenth among preventable risk factors contributing to the global burden of disease. Further research is necessary to better evaluate the respiratory health effects of indoor pollution and to implement protective programmes for public health.

But as the limit values of all pollutants are not known the exact determination of required ventilation rates based on pollutant concentrations is seldom possible. The selection of ventilation rates has to be based also on epidemiological research, laboratory and field experiments and experience. The existing literature indicates that ventilation has a significant impact on several important human outcomes including: (1) communicable respiratory illnesses; (2) sick building syndrome symptoms; (3) task performance and productivity, and (4) perceived air quality (PAQ) among occupants or sensory panels (5) respiratory allergies and asthma. In many studies, prevalence of sick building syndrome symptoms has also been associated with characteristics of HVAC-systems. Often the prevalence of SBS symptoms is higher in air-conditioned buildings than in naturally ventilated buildings. The evidence suggests that better hygiene, commissioning, operation and maintenance of air handling systems may be particularly important for reducing the negative effects of HVAC systems. Ventilation may also have harmful effects on indoor air quality and climate if not properly designed, installed, maintained and operated. Ventilation may bring indoors harmful substances or deteriorate indoor environment. Ventilation interacts also with the building envelope and may deteriorate the structures of the building. Ventilation changes the pressure differences across the structures of building and may cause or prevent infiltration of pollutants from structures or adjacent spaces. Ventilation is also in many cases used to control the thermal environment or humidity in buildings. The paper summarises the current knowledge on positive and negative effects of ventilation on health and other human responses. The focus is on office-type working environment and residential buildings.

ALVEOLAR TISSUE; T-LYMPHOCYTES; EMPHYSEMA	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive syndrome of expiratory airflow limitation caused by chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. The airway inflammatory response in COPD is initiated by smoking in the overwhelming majority of cases, and chronic exposure to cigarette smoke initiates a series of events that causes damage to central airways, peripheral airways, and terminal airspaces, leading to physiologic and clinical abnormalities. Although COPD shares some clinical features with asthma, another prevalent airway inflammatory disease, there are distinct differences in the phenotypic characteristics of airway inflammation between COPD and asthma. The eosinophil is the most prominent inflammatory cell in asthma, with mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages playing important but less prominent roles. In COPD the cellular composition of the airway inflammatory infiltrate differs, with neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes assuming prominence and the eosinophil playing a minor role, except in the setting of exacerbations. The contrasting inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and COPD have important implications for clinical and physiologic manifestations of disease, as well as for therapy.

If the animals receive drugs such as antibiotics, residues of these substances may occur in manure, in the air, or on surfaces of the respective animal house. In a retrospective study, we investigated dust samples collected during two decades from the same piggery for the occurrence of various antibiotics. In 90% of these samples, we detected up to five different antibiotics, including tylosin, various tetra-cyclines, sulfamethazine, and chloramphenicol, in total amounts up to 12.5 mg/kg dust. High dust exposure in animal confinement buildings is believed to be a respiratory health hazard because of the high content of microorganisms, endotoxins, and allergens. Further risks may arise from the inhalation of dust contaminated with a cocktail of antibiotics.

While building up its immune system, the infant is supported by the transplacental IgG antibodies, which also contain anti-idiotypic antibodies, possibly also actively priming the offspring. The second mode of transfer of immunity occurs via the milk. Numerous major protective components, including secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies and lactoferrin, are present. The breastfed infant is better protected against numerous common infections than the non-breastfed. Breastfeeding also seems to actively stimulate the infant's immune system by anti-idiotypes, uptake of milk lymphocytes, cytokines, etc. Therefore, the breastfed child continues to be better protected against various infections for some years. Vaccine responses are also often enhanced in breastfed infants. Long-lasting protection against certain immunological diseases such as allergies and celiac disease is also noted.

The two monoterpenes linalool and d -limonene are the most frequently incorporated fragrance chemicals in scented products. Previous studies on d -limonene show that this monoterpene oxidizes on air exposure (autoxidation) and that allergenic oxidation products are formed. Due to structural similarities, linalool might also form allergenic oxidation products on air exposure. The aim of the present study was to study the autoxidation of linalool and to investigate the sensitizing potential of linalool before and after air exposure. Linalool was oxidized for 10 weeks and gas chromatographic analyses showed that the content of linalool decreased to about 80%. The chromatograms revealed the formation of other compounds during oxidation. One of the major oxidation products was isolated and identified as 7-hydroperoxy-3,7-dimethyl-octa-1,5-diene-3-ol. This substance is, to the best of our knowledge, described for the first time. In sensitization studies in guinea pigs, linalool of high purity gave no reactions, while linalool that had been oxidized for 10 weeks sensitized the animals. It is concluded that autoxidation of linalool is essential for its sensitizing potential.

Design: Randomized controlled trial of educational intervention vs usual care. Setting: The pediatric pulmonary service of a regional pediatric hospital. Participants: ETS-exposed, Medicaid/Niedi-Cal-eligible, predominantly minority children who were 3 to 12 years old and who were seen for asthma in the hospital's emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services departments (n = 87). Intervention: Three nurse-led sessions employing behavior-changing strategies and basic asthma education and that incorporated repeated feedback on the child's urinary cotinine level. Measurements: The primary measurements were the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR) and the number of acute asthma medical visits. The secondary measurements were number of hospitalizations, smoking restrictions in home, amount smoked, reported exposures of children, and asthma control. Results: The intervention was associated with a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) for more than one acute asthma medical visit in the follow-up year, after adjusting for baseline visits (total visits, 87; OR, 0.32; p = 0.03), and a comparably sized but nonsignificant OR for one or more hospitalization (OR, 0.34; p = 0.14). The follow-up CCR measurement and the determination of whether smoking was prohibited inside the home strongly favored the intervention group (n = 51) (mean difference in CCR adjusted for baseline, -0.38; p = 0.26; n = 51) (60; OR [for proportion of subjects prohibiting smoking], 0.24; p = 0.11; n = 60). Conclusions: This intervention significantly reduced asthma health-care utilization in ETS-exposed, low-income, minority children. Effects sizes for urine cotinine and proportion prohibiting smoking were moderate to large but not statistically significant, possibly the result of reduced precision due to the loss of patients to active follow-up.

We hypothesized that high prenatal exposure to indoor antigens increases the risk for sensitization in newborns in New York City populations with increased risk for asthma. We also investigated whether maternal sensitization is required for in utero sensitization to occur. One hundred sixty-seven pregnant African American or Dominican women residing in northern Manhattan were recruited and antigen was measured from home dust. After delivery, newborn cord and maternal blood were assayed for IgE and mononuclear cell proliferation and cytokine production in response to antigen. Cockroach, mouse, but not dust mite antigens, were commonly elevated in the kitchens and pregnant mothers' beds. Increased mononuclear cell proliferation occurred in 54% of newborns in response to cockroach, 25% in response to dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 40% in response to dust mite D. farinae, and 34% in response to mouse protein extracts. Antigen-induced mononuclear cell proliferation occurred in cord blood even in the absence of antigen-induced mononuclear cell proliferation in the mother. Proliferation in response to antigens did not correlate with IgE levels, but proliferation in response to dust mite extracts correlated with interluekin-5 (IL-5) production in cord blood. These results suggest that (1) high prenatal exposures to cockroach and mouse antigens are prevalent; (2) in utero sensitization to multiple indoor antigens is common, occurs to a different degree than maternal sensitization, and may involve IL-5 uprequlation.

Apoptotic cell clearance by bronchial epithelial cells critically influences airway inflammation	NATURE			English	Article							DUST MITE ALLERGEN; ASTHMA; RESPONSES; FAMILY; ENGULFMENT; MECHANISM; MIMICRY; PROTEIN; INNATE; MOUSE	Lung epithelial cells can influence immune responses to airway allergens(1,2). Airway epithelial cells also undergo apoptosis after encountering environmental allergens(3); yet, relatively little is known about how these are cleared, and their effect on airway inflammation. Here we show that airway epithelial cells efficiently engulf apoptotic epithelial cells and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, dependent upon intracellular signalling by the small GTPase Rac1. Inducible deletion of Rac1 expression specifically in airway epithelial cells in a mouse model resulted in defective engulfment by epithelial cells and aberrant anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal priming and challenge of these mice with house dust mite extract or ovalbumin as allergens led to exacerbated inflammation, augmented Th2 cytokines and airway hyper-responsiveness, with decreased interleukin (IL)-10 in bronchial lavages. Rac1-deficient epithelial cells produced much higher IL-33 upon allergen or apoptotic cell encounter, with increased numbers of nuocyte-like cells(1,4,5). Administration of exogenous IL-10 'rescued' the airway inflammation phenotype in Rac1-deficient mice, with decreased IL-33. Collectively, these genetic and functional studies suggest a new role for Rac1-dependent engulfment by airway epithelial cells and in establishing the anti-inflammatory environment, and that defects in cell clearance in the airways could contribute to inflammatory responses towards common allergens.

The epithelium-associated cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33 are suggested to be important for the initiation of these responses. Objective: We sought to investigate the contributions of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the development of allergic disease to the common allergens house dust mite (HDM) or peanut. Methods: Neutralizing antibodies or mice deficient in TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33 signaling were exposed to HDM intranasally or peanut intragastrically, and immune inflammatory and physiologic responses were evaluated. In vitro assays were performed to examine specific dendritic cell (DC) functions. Results: We showed that experimental HDM-induced allergic asthma and food allergy and anaphylaxis to peanut were associated with TSLP production but developed independently of TSLP, likely because these allergens functionally mimicked TSLP inhibition of IL-12 production and induction of OX40 ligand (OX40L) on DCs. Blockade of OX40L significantly lessened allergic responses to HDM or peanut. Although IL-25 and IL-33 induced OX40L on DCs in vitro, only IL-33 signaling was necessary for intact allergic immunity, likely because of its superior ability to induce DC OX40L and expand innate lymphoid cells in vivo. Conclusion: These data identify a nonredundant, IL-33-driven mechanism initiating T(H)2 responses to the clinically relevant allergens HDM and peanut. Our findings, along with those in infectious and transgenic/surrogate allergen systems, favor a paradigm whereby multiple molecular pathways can initiate T(H)2 immunity, which has implications for the conceptualization and manipulation of these responses in health and disease.

Persistence of multiple illnesses in World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers: a cohort study	LANCET			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS; CENTER DISASTER; LUNG-FUNCTION; HEALTH; FIREFIGHTERS; ASTHMA; STRATEGIES; EXPOSURE; COLLAPSE; ATTACKS	Background More than 50000 people participated in the rescue and recovery work that followed the Sept 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC). Multiple health problems in these workers were reported in the early years after the disaster. We report incidence and prevalence rates of physical and mental health disorders during the 9 years since the attacks, examine their associations with occupational exposures, and quantify physical and mental health comorbidities. Methods In this longitudinal study of a large cohort of WTC rescue and recovery workers, we gathered data from 27 449 participants in the WTC Screening, Monitoring, and Treatment Program. The study population included police officers, firefighters, construction workers, and municipal workers. We used the Kaplan-Meier procedure to estimate cumulative and annual incidence of physical disorders (asthma, sinusitis, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease), mental health disorders (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and panic disorder), and spirometric abnormalities. Incidence rates were assessed also by level of exposure (days worked at the WTC site and exposure to the dust cloud). Findings 9-year cumulative incidence of asthma was 27.6% (number at risk: 7027), sinusitis 42.3% (5870), and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 39.3% (5650). In police officers, cumulative incidence of depression was 7.0% (number at risk: 3648), PTSD 9.3% (3761), and panic disorder 8.4% (3780). In other rescue and recovery workers, cumulative incidence of depression was 27.5% (number at risk: 4200), PTSD 31.9% (4342), and panic disorder 21.2% (4953). 9-year cumulative incidence for spirometric abnormalities was 41.8% (number at risk: 5769); three-quarters of these abnormalities were low forced vital capacity. Incidence of most disorders was highest in workers with greatest WTC exposure. Extensive comorbidity was reported within and between physical and mental health disorders. Interpretation 9 years after the 9/11 WTC attacks, rescue and recovery workers continue to have a substantial burden of physical and mental health problems. These findings emphasise the need for continued monitoring and treatment of the WTC rescue and recovery population.

The role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in allergic disorders	CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; AIRWAY EPITHELIAL-CELLS; IGM(+) B-CELLS; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS; NETHERTON-SYNDROME; IN-VITRO; INFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR	The importance of the epithelium in initiating and controlling immune responses is becoming more appreciated. For example, allergen contact first occurs at mucosal sites exposed to the external environment, such as the skin, airways and gastrointestinal tract. This exposure leads to the production of a variety of cytokines and chemokines that are involved in driving allergic inflammatory responses. One such product is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Recent studies, in both humans and mouse models, have implicated TSLP in the development and progression of atopy and atopic diseases.

T Cell/Transmembrane, Ig, and Mucin-3 Allelic Variants Differentially Recognize Phosphatidylserine and Mediate Phagocytosis of Apoptotic Cells	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							TIM GENE FAMILY; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; IN-VIVO; PERIPHERAL TOLERANCE; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE; ACTIVATION; RECEPTOR; MECHANISMS; EXPOSURE	T cell/transmembrane, Ig, and mucin (TIM) proteins, identified using a congenic mouse model of asthma, critically regulate innate and adaptive immunity. TIM-1 and TIM-4 are receptors for phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), exposed on the surfaces of apoptotic cells. Herein, we show with structural and biological studies that TIM-3 is also a receptor for PtdSer that binds in a pocket on the N-terminal IgV domain in coordination with a calcium ion. The TIM-3/PtdSer structure is similar to that of TIM-4/PtdSer, reflecting a conserved PtdSer binding mode by TIM family members. Fibroblastic cells expressing mouse or human TIM-3 bound and phagocytosed apoptotic cells, with the BALB/c allelic variant of mouse TIM-3 showing a higher capacity than the congenic C.D2 Es-Hba-allelic variant. These functional differences were due to structural differences in the BC loop of the IgV domain of the TIM-3 polymorphic variants. In contrast to fibroblastic cells, T or B cells expressing TIM-3 formed conjugates with but failed to engulf apoptotic cells. Together these findings indicate that TIM-3-expressing cells can respond to apoptotic cells, but the consequence of TIM-3 engagement of PtdSer depends on the polymorphic variants of and type of cell expressing TIM-3. These findings establish a new paradigm for TIM proteins as PtdSer receptors and unify the function of the TIM gene family, which has been associated with asthma and autoimmunity and shown to modulate peripheral tolerance.

On the other hand, patients with bronchial asthma are sensitive to inhaled substances including particulate matters. This Study examined the effects of pulmonary exposure to a type of nano-sized carbon nanotube (multi-walled nanotubes: MWCNT) on allergic airway inflammation in vivo and their cellular mechanisms in vitro. In vivo, ICR mice were divided into 4 experimental groups. Vehicle, MWCNT (50 mu g/animal), ovalbumin (OVA), and OVA + MWCNT were repeatedly administered intratracheally. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity, lung histology, levels of cytokines related to allergic inflammation in lung homogenates/BAL fluids (BALF's), and serum immunoglobulin levels were Studied. Also, we evaluated the impact of MWCNT (0.1-1 mu g/ml) on the phenotype and function of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. MWCNT aggravated allergen-induced airway inflammation characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells in the lung, and an increase in the number of goblet cells in the bronchial epithelium. MWCNT with allergen amplified lung protein levels of Th cytokines and chemokines compared with allergen alone. MWCNT exhibited adjuvant activity for allergen-specific IgG(1) and IgE. MWCNT significantly increased allergen (OVA)-specific syngeneic T-cell proliferation, particularly at a lower concentration in vitro. Taken together, MWCNT can exacerbate murine allergic airway inflammation, at least partly, via the promotion of a Th-dominant milieu. In addition, the exacerbation may be partly through the inappropriate activation of antigen-presenting cells including DC. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Objectives: To study whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD 14 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4 and TLR9 genes are associated with asthma in adults, and whether these SNPs modify associations between country living and asthma. Methods: Twenty-five SNPs in CD14, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 genes were genotyped in adult subjects from the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma, Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness, and Atopy (EGEA). We conducted a case-control analysis on unrelated subjects (239 with asthma and 596 without asthma), and a family-based association test (FBAT) in 192 families ascertained through probands with asthma. Measurements and Main Results: The TLR2/+596 C allele was associated with an increased risk for asthma in both case-control and family-based analyses (under a dominant model, odds ratio [OR] 1.91 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.72, P = 0.0003; Z statistics from FBAT = 2.48, P = 0.01). In skin prick test (SPT) positive subjects, the CD14/-260 C allele was negatively associated with asthma (additive model, OR 0.66; CI 0.48-0.91). Significant gene-environment interactions between variation in CD14 and TLR genes and country living during childhood were found for ten SNPs. In SPT positive subjects carrying CD14/-260 CC, country living protected against asthma (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.85), whereas country living was not associated with asthma in subjects who were atopic and carrying CD14/-260 T (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65-1.90) (gene-environment interaction, P < 0.05). Conclusions: TLR2 and CD14 SNPs were associated with asthma and atopic asthma respectively. In addition, CD14, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 SNPs modified associations between country living and asthma.

The danger within: endogenous danger signals, atopy and asthma	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review							TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; REGULATORY T-CELLS; EOSINOPHILIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; NOD-LIKE RECEPTORS; DENDRITIC CELLS; INHALED ANTIGEN; NONATOPIC ASTHMA; TH2 RESPONSES; P2X RECEPTORS; MOUSE MODEL	In allergic asthmatics, airway inflammation is triggered by specific (inhalation of allergen such as house dust mite allergen and pollen spores) or non-specific triggers (such as air pollutants and viral infection). Most of these inhaled particles are immunologically inert. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for priming and T helper-2 differentiation of naive T cells towards aeroallergens. Contamination of antigens with pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is required to activate DCs to mount an immune response. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as uric acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), also contribute to the induction of inflammation by activation and recruitment of various inflammatory cells. Compelling evidence suggests that a tight collaboration between PAMPs and DAMPs is needed to start an immune response to allergens. Several studies have recently demonstrated an important role of endogenous danger signals at the inception and maintenance phase of allergic disease. Further research into this area should focus on the possible role of these factors in maintenance of chronic disease and induction of airway remodelling.	[Willart, M. A. M.; Lambrecht, B.

The healthy worker effect in asthma - Work may cause asthma, but asthma may also influence work	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						epidemiology; asthma; occupational exposure; healthy worker effect	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; BODY SHOP WORKERS; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; OCCUPATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; AIRWAY RESPONSIVENESS; METALWORKING FLUIDS; UNITED-STATES; FOLLOW-UP; SELECTION; POPULATION	Despite the increasing attention to the relationship between asthma and work exposures, occupational asthma remains underrecognized and its population burden underestimated. This may be due, in part, to the fact that traditional approaches to studying asthma in populations cannot adequately take into account the healthy worker effect (HWE). The HWE is the potential bias caused by the phenomenon that sicker individuals may choose work environments in which exposures are low, they may be excluded from being hired; or once hired, they may seek transfer to less exposed jobs or leave work. This article demonstrates that population- and workplace-based asthma studies are particularly subject to HWE bias, which leads to underestimates of relative risks. Our objective is to describe the HWE as it relates to asthma research, and to discuss the significance of taking HWE bias into account in designing and interpreting asthma studies. We also discuss the importance of understanding HWE bias for public health practitioners and for clinicians. Finally, we emphasize the timeliness of this review in light of the many longitudinal "child to young adult" asthma cohort studies currently underway. These prospective studies will soon provide an ideal opportunity to examine the impact of early workplace environments on asthma in young adults. We urge occupational and childhood asthma epidemiologists collaborate to ensure that this opportunity is not lost.

Selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition has no effect on allergen challenge in asthma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						nitric oxide; bronchial hyperreactivity	REACTIVE NITROGEN; AIRWAY RESPONSIVENESS; EXHALED AIR; MILD ASTHMA; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; IN-VITRO; INFLAMMATION; GW274150; MONTELUKAST; POTENT	Rationale Exhaled breath nitric oxide (F-ENO) is increased in asthma. NO is produced predominantly by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Objectives: We evaluated the selective and potent NOS inhibitor GW274150 in asthma. Methods: Twenty-eight steroid-naive patients with asthma participated in a double-blind, randomized, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over study. Subjects received GW274150 (90 mg), montelukast (10 mg), or placebo once daily for 14 days. FENO was assessed predose on Days 1, 7, 10, and 14. Adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP) challenge was performed on Day 10, allergen challenge on Day 14 followed by methacholine challenge (MCh) 24 hours later, and then bronchoscopy. Measurements and Main Results: GW274150 reduced predose FENO by 73, 75, and 71% on Days 7, 10, and 14, respectively, compared with placebo. Montelukast did not reduce FENO. GW274150 did not inhibit AMP reactivity whereas for montelukast there was a trend toward inhibition: the mean doubling dose difference versus placebo was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 0 to 1.28). GW274150 did not inhibit early (EAR) and late (LAR) asthmatic responses to allergen, or MCh reactivity, despite reduced FEND levels. Montelukast inhibited EAR and LAIR FEV1; the mean difference versus placebo for minimal FEV1 was 0.37 L (95% Cl, 0.19 to 0.55) and 0.18 L (95% Cl, 0.04 to 0.32), respectively. MCh reactivity was inhibited by montelukast (mean doubling dose difference vs. placebo, 0.51; 95% Cl, 0.02 to 1.01). GW271540 also had no effect on inflammatory cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after allergen challenge. Conclusions: Selective iNOS inhibition effectively reduces FENO but does not affect airway hyperreactivity or airway inflammatory cell numbers after allergen challenge in subjects with asthma.

The etiology and immune mechanisms of food allergy, however, have remained poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain (TIM)-4, a recently identified member of cell surface molecules, in the pathogenesis of intestinal allergy in a murine model. Methods: We report that TIM-4 as well as costimulatory molecules were up-regulated in intestinal mucosal dendritic cells by in vitro or in vivo exposure to Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). SEB-conditioned intestinal dendritic cells loaded with a food macromolecule ovalbumin (OVA) induced potent OVA-specific T-helper (Th)2 lymphocyte responses in vitro and such Th2 responses were inhibited completely by TIM-4 blockade. Results: In vivo exposure to both SEB and OVA resulted in OVA-specific Th2 differentiation and intestinal allergic responses including increased serum immunoglobulin E and Th2 cytokine levels, activation of OVA-specific Th2 cells detected both ex vivo and in situ, and mast cell degranulation. Of importance, in vivo abrogation of TIM-4 or its cognate ligand TIM-1 by using a polyclonal antibody remarkably dampened Th2 differentiation and intestinal allergy. Conclusions: Our study thus identifies TIM-4 as a novel molecule critically required for the development of intestinal allergy.

A significant body of evidence suggests that these allergens mimic helper T (Th) 2 cell adjuvants. Der p 1 cleaves CD23 from activated B cells and CD25 from T cells. Der p I proteolytically degrades tight junctions in lung epithelium and causes release of proinflammatory cytokines from bronchial epithelial cells, mast cells, and basophils. These synergistic effects of mite enzyme allergens may promote IgE synthesis and have direct inflammatory effects on lung epithelium, which could explain why mite allergens are associated with asthma. The crystal structures of the proenzyme and mature forms of Der p 1 have been determined, as have the structures of other indoor allergens that are not enzymes (eg, Der p 2, Fel d 1, and Bla g 2). Cockroach allergens are strongly associated with asthma in US inner cities, yet none of the cockroach allergens that have been cloned are proteolytic enzymes. Thus although mite proteases allergens may act as Th2 adjuvants, a paradoxical effect is that other allergens may elicit strong Th2 responses in the absence of enzyme activity.

Prenatal versus postnatal sensitization to environmental allergens in a high-risk birth cohort	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						atopy; cytokines; IgE; IgG(4); T-cell memory; T(H)2	HOUSE-DUST MITE; T-CELL RESPONSES; CORD-BLOOD; INHALANT ALLERGENS; INDOOR ALLERGENS; MATERNAL INTAKE; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; GRASS-POLLEN; DIETARY EGG; CHILDREN	Background: The timing of allergen sensitization is controversial, with conflicting evidence suggesting transplacental priming versus exclusively postnatal priming. Resolution of this question is important in relation to rational design of allergy prevention strategies, particularly the issue of allergen avoidance during pregnancy. Objective: To elucidate the kinetics of sensitization in high-risk children during their first 2 years of life. Methods: We prospectively studied house dust mite (HDM)specific IgE and IgG(4) antibody production and associated T-cell immunity in a cohort of 200 high-risk infants. Parallel antibody studies tracked responses against a broader panel of inhalant and dietary allergens including peanut. Results: HDM-induced T-H(2) responses in PBMC from 6 months onward, particularly IL-4 and IL-5, correlated increasingly strongly with sensitization outcomes at 2 years, and a I contrasting negative relationship was observed with IFN-T response capacity. HDM-induced T-cell responses in cord blood, although common, were unrelated to subsequent sensitization. Transient HDM-IgE (and IgG4) production frequently peaked at 6 or 12 months before returning to baseline, which suggests the onset of protective tolerance. This finding contrasted wi th progressively increasing HDM titers in children sensitized by 2 years of age. Comparably contrasting patterns were observed in peanut-specific responses in sensitized versus nonsensitized children. Conclusion: Priming of T-H(2) responses associated with persistent HDM-IgE production occurs entirely postnatally, as HDM reactivity in cord blood seems nonspecific and is unrelated to subsequent development of allergen-specific T-H(2) memory or TgE. Clinical implications: These findings question the scientific basis for existing recommendations for allergen avoidance by high-risk women during pregnancy.

One TNF promoter variant (G-308A) affects expression of TNF and has been associated with inflammatory diseases; however, studies of asthma have been inconsistent. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the -308 TNF polymorphism with asthma may vary by ozone exposure and variants of oxidant defense genes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1. Objectives: To investigate the association of TNF G-308A with asthma and wheezing and to determine whether these associations vary with ozone exposure and GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotype. Methods: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with lifetime and current wheezing and asthma among 3,699 children in the Children's Health Study. We examined differences in associations with community ozone and by GSTM1 null and GSTP1 105 Ile/Val (A105G) genotype. Results: Children with TNF-308 GG had decreased risk of asthma (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9) and lifetime wheezing (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9). The protective effects of GG genotype on wheezing outcomes were of greater magnitude in lower compared with higher ozone communities. These findings were replicated in the two cohorts of fourth-grade children recruited in 1993 and 1996. The reduction of the protective effect from the -308 GG genotype with higher ozone exposure was most marked in the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile groups. Conclusions: The TNF-308 GG genotype may have a protective role in asthma pathogenesis, depending on airway oxidative stress levels.

Ultrafine particles (diameter <100 nm) may contribute to these adverse effects. Objective: To investigate potential adjuvant activity of inhaled elemental carbon ultrafine particles (EC-UFPs) on allergic airway inflammation. Methods: The effects of ultrafine particle inhalation on allergic airway inflammation was analyzed in ovalbumin-sensitized mice and nonsensitized controls. Particle exposure (526 mu g/m(3), 24 hours) was performed 24, 96, or 168 hours before or 24 or 72 hours after ovalbumin aerosol challenge. Allergic inflammation was analyzed at different time points after allergen challenge by means of bronchoalveolar lavage cell count and cytokine/total protein assays, lung histology, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Results: In sensitized mice, inhalation of ultrafine particles 24 hours before allergen challenge caused a significant increase of bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cell infiltrate, protein, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 compared with relevant controls. These adjuvant effects were dose- and time-dependent and were still present when particle exposure was performed 4 days before allergen challenge. The adjuvant effect of ultrafine particles was also documented by increased mucus production, peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation, and enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness. In contrast, particle exposure in sensitized mice after allergen challenge caused only moderate effects, such as a delay of inflammatory infiltrate and a reduction of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusion: Exposure to ultrafine carbon particles before allergen challenge exerts strong adjuvant effects on the manifestation of allergic airway inflammation. Allergen-sensitized individuals may therefore be more susceptible to detrimental health effects of ultrafine particles.

Farmers are at high risk of exposure to both of these hazards. Very limited information, however is available on the combined exposures to both hazards on different types of farms. Moreover most of the previous studies have measured the mass concentration of particles ignoring the particle size. In this study, farmers' exposure to airborne dust and microorganisms was studied using our newly developed personal sampling system. Particle number concentration and size distribution were measured with an optical particle counter Simultaneously, particles were collected on a filter and analyzed for microorganisms. The field measurements were conducted in animal confinements (swine, poultry, and dairy) and during grain harvesting (corn and soybean). The ye concentrations on the results show the following avera workers' breathing zone.- 1. 7 x 10(6) to 2.9 x 10(7) particles/m(3) for total dust, 0.9 x 10(3) to 3.9 x 10(4) spores/m(3) for total fungal spores, 0.3 x 10(3) to 3.6 x 10(4) CFU/m(3) for culturable fungal spores, 0.3 x 10(4) to 3.3 x 10(8) CFU/m(3) for culturable bacteria, and limit of detection (LOD) to 2.8 x 103 CFU/m(3) for culturable actinomycetes in animal confinements. The respective concentrations were 4.4 x 10(6) to 5.8 x 10(7) particles/m(3), 3.4 x 10(4) to 6.1 x 10(6) spores/m(3), 8.2 x 10(4) to 7.4 x 10(6) CFU/m(3), 0.4 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(6) CFU/m(3), and LOD to 2.6 x 10(4) CFU/m(3) during grain harvesting. The highest contribution of large particles (3-10 mu m) in total particles was found during grain harvesting, whereas the size distribution was dominated by smaller particles (< 3 mu m) in animal confinements. High fraction (up to 37%) of particles between 2-10 mu m was found to be fungal spores. The results indicate that an increase in the concentration of large dust particles (2-10 mu m) during grain harvesting was partially, attributed to the increase in the concentration of the fungal spores. Overall, the combined exposure to airborne dust and microorganisms was found to be more severe during harvesting than in animal confinements.

Most-but not all-Hispanics have variable proportions of European, Amerindian, and African ancestry. Hispanics are diverse with regard to many factors, including racial ancestry, country of origin, area of residence, socioeconomic status, education, and access to health care. Recent findings suggest that there is marked variation in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of asthma in Hispanics in the United States and in Hispanic America. The reasons for differences in asthma and asthma morbidity among and within Hispanic subgroups are poorly understood but are likely due to the interaction between yet-unidentified genetic variants and other factors, including environmental tobacco smoke exposure, obesity, allergen exposure, and availability of health care. Barriers to optimal management of asthma in Hispanics in the United States and in Hispanic America include inadequate access to health care, suboptimal use of antiinflammatory medications, and lack of reference values for spirometric measures of lung function in many subgroups (e.g., Puerto Ricans). Future studies of asthma in Hispanics should include large samples of subgroups that are well characterized with regard to self-reported ethnicity, country of origin, place of birth, area of residence, and indicators of socioeconomic status. Because Hispanics are disproportionately represented among the poor in the United States, implementation of adequate access to health care and social reforms (e.g., improving housing conditions) would likely have a major impact on reducing asthma morbidity in this population.

The recruitment of pregnant women started in October 2000. First, participants with 'conventional lifestyles' (n = 2343) were retrieved from an ongoing prospective cohort study (n = 7020) on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain. In addition, pregnant women (n = 491) with 'alternative lifestyles' with regard to child rearing practices, dietary habits (organic, vegetarian), vaccination schemes and/or use of antibiotics, were recruited through organic food shops, anthroposophic doctors and midwives, Steiner schools, and dedicated magazines. All participants were enrolled between 14 and 18 wk of gestation and completed an intake questionnaire on family history of atopy and infant care intentions. Documentation of other relevant variables started in the pregnant mother and covered the first and third trimester as well as early childhood by repeated questionnaires at 14-18, 30, and 34 wk of gestation and 3, 7, 12, and 24 months postpartum. A subgroup of participants, including both conventional and alternative lifestyles, was asked to consent to maternal blood sampling, breast milk and a faecal sample of the infant at I month post-partum, capillary blood at age 1 yr, venous blood and observation of manifestation of atopic dermatitis during home visits at the age of 2 yr (using the UK working party criteria and the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index), and buccal swabs for DNA isolation from child-parent trios. From the start, ethical approval and informed consent procedures included gene-environment interaction studies. Follow-up at 3 and 7 months post-partum was completed with high response rates (respectively 90% and 88% in the conventional group, and 97% and 97% in the alternative group). The home visits at 2 yr of age will be completed in 2005. Preliminary results show that we have succeeded in recruiting a large population with various lifestyle choices with a fairly large contrast with regard to dietary habits (including organic foods, vegetarian diet), vaccination schemes and/or use of antibiotics. We have also been able to collect a large number of faecal samples (n = 1176) and capillary blood samples at age 1 yr (n = 956). Furthermore, a large proportion of the participants have consented with genetic studies. Mid 2006 we expect to report our first results on the relationship between the various exposures in early life and childhood atopy. An outline of the focus and design of the KOALA Birth Cohort Study is presented.

A Poisson regression model was used to determine the statistical relationship between acute paediatric asthma A&E visits and Saharan dust cover with and without other variables such as climatic parameters and month. During the study period, there were 2,655 A&E visits for acute asthma. There was an association between increased paediatric asthma admissions and increased Saharan dust cover. The best fitting model estimated that in one month, such as June, a deterioration of visibility due to increased Saharan dust cover from no dust (visibility =16 km) to very dusty (visibility =7 km) would increase a daily admission rate of 7.8 patients to 9.25 when climate variables such as barometric pressure and humidity were kept constant.

Generally, these findings support the 'hygiene hypothesis', which attributes the rise in autoimmune and atopic disorders to a lack of infections that normally keep the immune system balanced by inducing immunoregulation. The suspected key players for infection-mediated immune suppression of autoimmunity and atopy are T regulatory cells and dendritic cells, which produce immunosuppressive cytokines, such as interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. However, there is also solid evidence suggesting that infections can exacerbate or even directly cause autoimmune and allergic disorders. In this Review, we discuss which type of infections induce, exacerbate or inhibit allergic and autoimmune diseases and point at infection-induced immunological mechanisms influencing the development of autoimmunity and atopy.

Although it is unlikely that vasoconstriction and hyperemia of the bronchial vasculature are essential events for EIB, it is likely that this vasculature enhances the airway response to dehydration and contributes to the pathogenesis of EIB, particularly in elite athletes. Accumulating evidence suggests that airway smooth muscle (ASM) becomes more sensitive as a result of repeated exposure to bulk plasma in response to airway injury from dehydration. Recent evidence also demonstrates sufficient concentrations of mediators that could affect ASM. Paradoxically, mediator release from mast cells may be enhanced and their contractile effects greater when beta(2)-receptor agonists are taken daily. The effect of drugs that have the potential to reduce microvascular leak and reduce or inhibit release or action of these mediators needs to be investigated in elite athletes.

This observation has led many to question whether air quality is truly a significant risk factor in the development and exacerbation of asthma and whether further improvement in air quality is likely to result in improved health outcomes. However, epidemiologic studies have shown that levels of pollutants of less than the current ambient air quality standards still result in exacerbations of asthma and are associated with other morbidities as well. Specific locations, such as living near a roadway, might pose a special exposure risk. Genetic factors almost certainly play a role in determining susceptibility to pollutants, such as including those involved with antioxidant defenses. The best studied of these in the context of air pollution risks are glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms. Irrespective of whether pollutants contribute to the development of asthma or the well-documented increases in asthma results in more people having pollutant-induced disease, poor air quality in many places remains a significant problem for patients with asthma and allergic disease. A number of public health, pharmaceutical, and nutriceutical interventions might mitigate the effects of pollutant exposure and deserve further study.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) was used to quantify Amb a 1, ragweed's major allergen, in protein extracted from pollen of A. artemisiifolia grown at different [CO2] values in a previous experiment. The concentrations used approximated atmospheric pre-industrial conditions (i.e. at the end of the 19th century), current conditions, and the CO2 concentration projected for the middle of the 21st century ( 280, 370 and 600 mu mol mol(-1) CO2, respectively). Although total pollen protein remained unchanged, significant increases in Amb a 1 allergen were observed between pre-industrial and projected future [CO2] and between current and projected future [CO2] (1.8 and 1.6 times, respectively). These data suggest that recent and projected increases in [CO2] could directly increase the allergenicity of ragweed pollen and consequently the prevalence and / or severity of seasonal allergic disease. However, genetic and abiotic factors governing allergen expression will need to be better established to fully understand these data and their implications for public health.

The prevalences of both atopy and asthma have shown substantial variation. Objective: We sought to assess geographic variations in the fraction of asthma attributable to IgE sensitization to specific allergens in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken during the years 1991 and 1992 on 13,558 individuals in 36 centers in 16 countries. Asthma was defined in several ways, variously incorporating reported symptoms, bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, and physician diagnosis. Specific IgE against house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), cat, timothy grass, Cladosporium herbarum, and a local allergen (birch, Parietaria judaica, or ragweed) were measured. Results: The overall attributable fraction (AF) of asthma symptoms caused by atopy was 30% but varied widely between centers, ranging from 4% to 61%. The overall AF increased to 43% when asthma was based on wheezing and bronchial responsiveness, to 45% with a physician diagnosis of asthma, and to 48% when the patient reported more than 12 attacks in the last year. Between centers, the AF for atopy was significantly correlated with the prevalence of atopy among the asthmatic patients (r = 0.91) and with the sensitization to house dust mite (r = 0.64), as well as with the prevalence of asthma among atopic individuals (r = 0.43) and the prevalence of asthma among nonatopic individuals (r = -0.51). Conclusion: The effect of atopy on the prevalence of asthma varies widely between centers, probably because of variations in factors related to the expression of asthma and to the prevalence of sensitization, particularly to house dust mite.

The expression levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, Interferongamma (IFN-gamma). t-bet, IL-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were measured in BAL cells obtained from control and RAO-susceptible horses during an asymptomatic phase and at 24 It and 5 weeks post-stabling and hay exposure. At each sampling time, BAL neutrophil percentages in the RAO-group exceeded controls. In the RAO-group, only IL-13 expression was decreased 2-fold during the asymptomatic phase. No differences in cytokine or chemokine expression were detected during the acute exposure phase. During the chronic phase, IFN-gamma and IL-8 expression levels were 2.5- and 3-fold greater, respectively, in the RAO-group. No other differences in gene expression were detected. We conclude that the cytokine profile of the airway cells does not reflect a polarized Th-2 response; that increases in IFN-gamma result from a t-bet independent pathway and that chemokines from epithelial or interstitial cells may contribute to early neutrophil influx.

To examine stability over time and seasonal variation, we measured concentrations of mite and cat allergens, endotoxin and mold spores in living room floor dust in 745 German homes collected twice a year in two different seasons. The study population consisted of adults and children living in five different areas in Germany. All dust samples were collected in a standardized manner from the living room floor and taken during the years 1995 to 1998. The median interval between the two dust samplings was approximately 7 months. Mite and cat allergens were measured in settled house dust by monoclonal antibodies, endotoxin by the limulus amebocyte lysate method, and total spore counts by cultural methods. Crude Pearson's correlation coefficients between log-transformed concentrations in the first and second dust samples ranged between 0.65 and 0.75 for allergens, 0.59 for endotoxin and only 0.06 for total spore counts. The strongest and most consistent seasonal effects were observed for fungi with highest levels in July-September. Cat allergen concentrations were found consistently to be increased in January-March. Mite allergens did not show a strong and consistent seasonal pattern. We conclude that repeated measurements of mite and cat allergens and endotoxin in settled house dust improve the estimate for annual mean concentrations. However, even a single observation of these biocontaminants may be a good proxy for a 1-year exposure since repeated measures were highly correlated. However, repeated measurements of fungi levels were only weakly correlated and thus repeated observations for assessment of annual means of total spore counts are needed.

They have received increasing interest over the past decade, but their prevalence remains uncertain and their pathophysiology is not fully understood. The Contrast Media Safety Committee of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology decided to review the literature and to issue guidelines. An extensive literature search was carried out and summarized in a report. Based on the available information, simple guidelines have been drawn up. The report and guidelines were discussed at the 8th European Symposium on Urogenital Radiology in Genoa. Late adverse reactions after intravascular iodinated contrast medium include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, itching, skin rash, musculoskeletal pain, and fever. A significant proportion of these reactions is unrelated to the contrast medium; however, allergy-like skin reactions are well-documented side effects of contrast media with an incidence of approximately 2%. Late reactions appear to be commoner after nonionic dimers. The majority of late skin reactions after contrast medium exposure are probably T cell-mediated allergic reactions. Patients at increased risk of late skin reactions are those with a history of previous contrast medium reaction and those on interluekin-2 treatment.

Days of wheeze or persistent cough, information on maternal allergy and asthma, socioeconomic variables, and housing characteristics were collected over the course of the infant's first year of life. Exposure to mold was assessed by airborne samples collected at one time early in the infant's life. Fungi were identified to genus level, recorded as colony-forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m(3)), and then categorized into four levels: 0 (undetectable), 1-499 CFU/m(3) (low), 500-999 CFU/m(3) (medium), and 1,000 CFU/m(3) (high). Effects of mold on wheeze and persistent cough, adjusting for potential confounding factors, were examined with Poisson regression analyses. The two most commonly found genera were Cladosporium (in 62% of the homes) and Penicillium (41%). Cladosporium was associated with reported mold (p < 0.02) and water leaks (p < 0.003). Rate of persistent cough was associated with reported mold [Rate ratio (RR) = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88]. The highest level of Penicillium was associated with higher rates of wheeze (RR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.46) and persistent cough (RR = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.31-3.24) in models controlling for maternal history of asthma and allergy, socioeconomic status, season of mold sample, and certain housing characteristics. We conclude that infants in this high-risk group who are exposed to high levels of Penicillium are at significant risk for wheeze and persistent cough.

In this study, we examined the effect of IL-13 on well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface culture. IL-13 induced proliferation of NHBE cells after 24 h exposure, as reflected by [H-3]thymidine uptake and cell counts. The effects of IL-13 were mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as proliferation was attenuated by AG1478, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Proliferation appeared to be mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, a potent ligand for EGFR, which was released rapidly from NHBE cells in response to IL-13. Neutralizing antibody to TGF-alpha, but not antibodies against other potentially important growth factors (EGF, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor [HB-EGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]), inhibited the mitogenic response to IL-13. This study provides the first experimental evidence that IL-13 can initiate a proliferative response of human airway epithelium in the absence of inflammatory cells or other cell types. The results are consistent with a mechanism whereby IL-13 induces release of TGF-alpha from the epithelial cells, which in turn binds via an autocrine/paracrine-type action to the EGFR, initiating proliferation. IL-13-induced airway remodeling in vivo may involve this epithelium-driven response.

Western blotting of Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae) extracts with sera from sensitized dogs showed that the majority of animals had IgE antibodies specific for two proteins of apparent molecular weights of 98 and 109 kDa (98/109 kDa). The N-terminal sequences of these two proteins were identical, suggesting they were very closely related, and sequencing of internal peptides showed the protein(s) to have homology with insect chitinases. A purified preparation of 98/109 kDa proteins elicited positive intradermal skin tests (IDST(s)) in a group of well-characterized atopic dogs sensitized to D. farinae, but not in normal dogs. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified proteins was used to immunoscreen a D. farinae cDNA library. The mature coding region of the isolated chitinase cDNA predicts a protein of 63.2 kDa; sequence analysis and glycan detection blotting suggest that the molecule is extensively O-glycosylated. Monoclonal antibodies made against the purified native protein were used to localize the chitinase in sections of whole D. farinae mites. The protein displayed an intracellular distribution in the proventriculus and intestine of the mite, suggesting that it has a digestive, rather than a moulting-related, function. The high prevalence of IgE antibodies to this antigen in canine atopic dermatitis makes it a major HDM allergen for dogs, and the protein has been formally designated Der f 15.

To evaluate the influence of early antiinflammatory therapy in the development of asthma 3 years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. In addition, the effects of allergic sensitization and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on the development of asthma were investigated. Design and Setting. A randomized, controlled follow-up study in a university hospital that provides primary hospital care for all pediatric patients in a defined area. Patients. Eighty-nine infants under 2 years of age who had been hospitalized for infection associated with wheezing and followed up for 3 years. Intervention. Early antiinflammatory therapy was given for 16 weeks; 29 patients received cromolyn sodium and 31 received budesonide. Twenty-nine control patients received no therapy. Outcome Measures. Clinical diagnosis of current asthma, defined as having at least 3 episodes of physician-diagnosed wheezing and either a wheezing episode during the preceding year or ongoing antiinflammatory medication for asthma. Results. Fourteen (48%) patients in the former cromolyn group, 15 (48%) in the former budesonide group, and 16 (55%) in the control group had current asthma. The significant predictors of asthma were age over 12 months (risk ratio [RR] 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59-10.35), history of wheezing (RR 6.8; CI = 1.35-34.43), and atopic dermatitis on study entry (RR 3.4; CI = 1.17-9.39). Skin prick test positivity at the age of 16 months significantly predicted asthma (RR 9.5; CI = 2.45-36.72). In addition, all of the 18 (20%) children sensitized with furred pet developed asthma. RSV identification (RR 0.3; CI = 0.08-0.80) and early furred pet contact at home (RR 0.3; CI 0.10-0.79) were associated with the decreased occurrence of asthma. Conclusions. Antiinflammatory therapy for 4 months has no influence on the occurrence of asthma 3 years after wheezing in infancy. Early sensitization to indoor allergens, especially to pets, and atopic dermatitis predict subsequent development of asthma. RSV infection in wheezing infants may have a better outcome than other infections.

We evaluated respiratory health in workers at a new wood products manufacturing plant that uses methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), and was designed and operated with a goal of minimizing worker exposures, Methods: Health surveys using standardized respiratory questionnaires were done prior to the initial use of diisocyanates in the plant, and semiannually thereafter for a period of 2 years. Other testing included occupational and work practice histories, serial peak flow measurements, spirometry, methacholine challenge, and measurement of specific IgE antibodies to MDI-albumin conjugate. Results: Of 214 plant employees who participated in at least one health survey, a follow-up survey was also available from 178 employees (83%). New-onset asthma-like symptoms (NAS) were reported by 15 of 56 workers (27%) in areas with the highest potential for exposures to liquid MDI monomer and prepolymer, vs 0 of 43 workers in the lowest potential exposure areas (p = 0.001). In the areas with high potential exposure, NAS developed in 47% of workers who had noted MDI skin staining, vs 19% without skin stains (p = 0.07), Working around and cleaning up liquid MDI represented a significant risk for asthma-like symptoms in both current smokers and nonsmokers; work with finished wood products did not. Asthma-like symptoms were associated with variable airflow limitation (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 18.7) and specific IgE to MDI-albumin (OR, 3.2; CI, 1.1 to 9.0), but not with skin prick tests to common aeroallergens (OR, 1.1; CI, 0.5 to 2.7), Conclusions: During the first 2 years of operation, in a plant designed and operated to control exposure to diisocyanates, the development of asthma-like symptoms was reported in a relatively high proportion of the employees who worked with liquid MDI. To prevent asthma symptoms among workers, careful control of respiratory tract exposures associated with liquid MDI is important, especially during cleanup activities. Strict limitation of skin contact with diisocyanates may also be necessary.

To test this hypothesis in children with asthma, we investigated the time- and dose-dependent effects of 2 doses of fluticasone propionate (FP, 100 or 250 mu g bid.) in improving exercise- (EIB) and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction during 6 months of treatment, using a placebo-controlled parallel group study design. Thirty-seven children with asthma (aged 6 to 14 years; forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV1) greater than or equal to 70% predicted; EIB greater than or equal to 20% fall in FEV1 from baseline; no inhaled steroids during the past 4 months) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm parallel study. Children receiving placebo were rerandomized to active treatment after 6 weeks. Standardized dry air treadmill exercise testing (EIB expressed as %fall in FEV1 from baseline) and methacholine challenge using a dosimetric technique (expressed as PD20) were performed repeatedly during the study. During FP-treatment, the severity of EIB decreased significantly as compared to placebo within 3 weeks, the geometric mean % fall in FEV1 being reduced from 34.1% to 9.9% for 100 mu g FP bid, and from 35.9% to 7.6% for 250 mu g FP bid (P < 0.05). These reductions in EIB did not differ between the 2 doses and were sustained throughout the treatment period. PD20 methacholine improved significantly during the first 6 weeks as compared to placebo (P < 0.04) and steadily increased with time in both treatment limbs (P = 0.04), the difference in improvement between doses (100 mu g FP bid, 1.6 dose steps; 250 mu g FP bid, 3.3 dose steps) approaching significance after 24 weeks (P = 0.06). We conclude that in childhood asthma, the protection afforded by inhaled fluticasone propionate against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction is time- and dose-dependent, whereas protection against EIB is not. This suggests different modes of action of inhaled steroids in protecting against these pharmacological and physiological stimuli. This has to be taken into account when monitoring asthma treatment.

Methods. This population-based cross-sectional study involved 2568 Finnish children aged 1 to 7 years. Results. In logistic regression models, lower respiratory tract symptoms-persistent wheezing (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13, 10.36), cough (OR=2.41, 95% CI = 1.04, 5.63), and phlegm (OR= 2.76, 95% Cf = 1.03, 7.41)-were strongly related to the presence of plastic wall materials, whereas upper respiratory symptoms were not. The risk of asthma (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.35, 6.71) and pneumonia (OR= 1.81, 95% CI = 0.62, 5.29) was also increased in children exposed to such materials. Conclusions. Emissions from plastic materials indoors may have adverse effects on the lower respiratory tracts of small children.

Spatiotemporally separated antigen uptake by alveolar dendritic cells and airway presentation to T cells in the lung	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEINS; DUST MITE ALLERGEN; IN-VIVO; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; LYMPH-NODE; 2-PHOTON MICROSCOPY; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; CHRONIC ASTHMA; ATOPIC ASTHMA; MOUSE	Asthma pathogenesis is focused around conducting airways. The reasons for this focus have been unclear because it has not been possible to track the sites and timing of antigen uptake or subsequent antigen presentation to effector T cells. In this study, we use two-photon microscopy of the lung parenchyma and note accumulation of CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs) around the airway after allergen challenge but very limited access of these airway-adjacent DCs to the contents of the airspace. In contrast, we observed prevalent transepithelial uptake of particulate antigens by alveolar DCs. These distinct sites are temporally linked, as early antigen uptake in alveoli gives rise to DC and antigen retention in the airway-adjacent region. Antigen-specific T cells also accumulate in the airway-adjacent region after allergen challenge and are activated by the accumulated DCs. Thus, we propose that later airway hyperreactivity results from selective retention of allergen-presenting DCs and antigen-specific T cells in airway-adjacent interaction zones, not from variation in the abilities of individual DCs to survey the lung.

Successful immunotherapy is accompanied by the suppression of numbers of T-helper 2 (Th2) effector cells, eosinophils, basophils, c-kit + mast cells and neutrophils infiltration in target organs, induction of IL-10 and/or TGF-beta + Treg cells and increases in 'protective' non-inflammatory blocking antibodies, particularly IgG4 and IgA2 subclasses with inhibitory activity. These events are accompanied by a reduction and/or a redirection of underlying antigen-specific Th2-type T cell-driven hypersensitivity to the allergen(s) used for therapy. This suppression occurs within weeks or months as a consequence of the appearance of a population of regulatory T cells that exert their effects by mechanisms involving cell-cell contact, but also by the release of cytokines such as IL-10 (increases IgG4) and TGF-beta (increases specific IgA). The more delayed-in-time appearance of antigen-specific T-helper 1 responses and alternative mechanisms such as Th2 cell anergy and/or apoptosis may also be involved. The mechanisms of sublingual immunotherapy are similar to those following a subcutaneous administration of allergen, whereas it is likely that additional events following antigen presentation in the sublingual mucosa and regional lymph nodes are involved. These insights have resulted in novel approaches and portend future biomarkers that may be surrogate or predictive of the clinical response to treatment.	[Shamji, M.

Here we report the results of a systematic review of published literature in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of this relationship. DATA SOURCES: After a comprehensive literature search, we identified seven peer-reviewed studies providing quantitative results regarding the association between formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to the definition of asthma (e.g., self-report, physician diagnosis). Most of the studies were cross-sectional. DATA EXTRACTION: For each study, an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for asthma were either abstracted from published results or calculated based on the data provided. Characteristics regarding the study design and population were also abstracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: We used fixed- and random-effects models to calculate pooled ORs and 95% Cls; measures of heterogeneity were also calculated. A fixed-effects model produced an OR of 1.03 (95% Cl, 1.02-1.04), and random effects model produced an OR of 1.17 (95% Cl, 1.01-1.36), both reflecting an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) of formaldehyde. Both the Q and I(2) statistics indicated a moderate amount of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a significant positive association between formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma. Given the largely cross-sectional nature of the studies underlying this meta-analysis, further well-designed prospective epidemiologic studies are needed.

The battle against Aspergillus fumigatus involves several components of the pulmonary innate immune system: cells, mediators, and natural antifungal molecules involved in the recognition and elimination of the fungus, thereby preventing colonization of the respiratory system. With the 10,000-15,000 1 of air we inhale each day, the lungs are constantly exposed to a wide range of microorganisms, such as A. fumigatus. This fungus is ubiquitous in the environment and can release large numbers of spores able, due to their small size, to penetrate the respiratory tract. The spores of A. fumigatus, like any other pathogen, are then confronted with the innate immune system, a constitutive defense system that is permanently active and tightly regulated. The various elements of the pulmonary innate immune system-physical and cellular barriers and soluble mediators-are involved in the recognition and elimination of pathogens, thereby preventing colonization of the respiratory system. Consequently, the presence of spores in immunocompetent hosts is completely innocuous, because these spores are normally eliminated. However, changes in one of the components of the defense system may lead to the development of pulmonary infections. Thus, in immunocompromised individuals, the spores are able to develop and cause pulmonary mycoses. These mycoses, known as aspergillosis, are highly variable, with the range of presentations extending from an allergy-type illness, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergilloses, to a very serious generalized and frequently fatal infection: invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).

It has been postulated that vitamin D deficiency may explain a portion of the asthma epidemic. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for a role of vitamin D in asthma. Recent findings Both animal models and studies in human fetal tissues show that vitamin D plays a role in fetal lung growth and maturation. Epidemiologic studies have also suggested that higher prenatal vitamin D intakes have a protective role against wheezing illnesses in young children. Vitamin D may protect against wheezing illnesses through its role in upregulating antimicrobial proteins or through its multiple immune effects. In addition, vitamin D may play a therapeutic role in steroid resistant asthmatics, and lower vitamin D levels have recently been associated with higher risks for asthma exacerbations. Summary Improving vitamin D status holds promise in primary prevention of asthma, in decreasing exacerbations of disease, and in treating steroid resistance. However, the appropriate level of circulating vitamin D for optimal immune functioning remains unclear. Because vitamin D deficiency is prevalent even in sun-replete areas, clinical trials are needed to definitively answer questions about the role of vitamin D in asthma.

The essential step in this progress is the generation of allergen-specific CD4(+) T-helper (Th) type 2 cells that mediate several effector functions. The influence of Th2 cytokines leads to the production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies by B cells, development and recruitment of eosinophils, mucus production and bronchial hyperreactivity, as well as tissue homing of other Th2 cells and eosinophils. Meanwhile, Th1 cells may contribute to chronicity and the effector phases. T cells termed T regulatory (Treg) cells, which have immunosuppressive functions and cytokine profiles distinct from that of either Th1 or Th2 cells, have been intensely investigated during the last 13 years. Treg cell response is characterized by an abolished allergen-specific T cell proliferation and the suppressed secretion of Th1 and Th2-type cytokines. Treg cells are able to inhibit the development of allergen-specific Th2 and Th1 cell responses and therefore play an important role in a healthy immune response to allergens. In addition, Treg cells potently suppress IgE production and directly or indirectly suppress the activity of effector cells of allergic inflammation, such as eosinophils, basophils and mast cells. Currently, Treg cells represent an exciting area of research, where understanding the mechanisms of peripheral tolerance to allergens may soon lead to more rational and safer approaches for the prevention and cure of allergic diseases.

Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) P1, GSTM1, exercise, ozone and asthma incidence in school children	THORAX			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES; AIR-POLLUTION; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; RISK-FACTORS; SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DIFFERING LEVELS; DIOL EPOXIDES	Background: Because asthma has been associated with exercise and ozone exposure, an association likely mediated by oxidative stress, we hypothesised that glutathione-S-transferase (GST) P1, GSTM1, exercise and ozone exposure have interrelated effects on the pathogenesis of asthma. Methods: Associations of the well characterised null variant of GSTM1 and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterised common variation in the GSTP1 locus with new onset asthma in a cohort of 1610 school children were examined. Children's exercise and ozone exposure were classified using participation in team sports and community annual average ozone levels, respectively. Results: A two SNP model involving putatively functional variants (rs6591255, rs1695 (Ile105Va)) best captured the association between GSTP1 and asthma. The risk of asthma was lower for those with the Val allele of Ile105Val (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8) and higher for the variant allele of rs6591255 (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). The risk of asthma increased with level of exercise among ile(105) homozygotes but not among those with at least one val(105) allele (interaction p value= 0.02). The risk was highest among ile(105) homozygotes who participated in >= 3 sports in the high ozone communities (HR 6.15, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.4). GSTM1 null was independently associated with an increased risk of asthma and showed little variation with air pollution or GSTP1 genotype. These results were consistent in two independent fourth grade cohorts recruited in 1993 and 1996. Conclusion: Children who inherit a val105 variant allele may be protected from the increased risk of asthma associated with exercise, especially in high ozone communities. GSTM1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of asthma.	[Islam, T.; Berhane, K.; McConnell, R.; Gauderman, W. J.; Avol, E.; Peters, J. M.; Gilliland, F.

However, there is limited information on how traffic-related emissions relate to lung function and airway inflammation. Objectives: To determine the differential association of traffic-related exposures with exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and lung volumes and symptoms in children with and without asthma. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study of 200 children from ages 6 to 12 years of whom half had physician-diagnosed asthma. Two-week NO(2) and 48-hour average levels of elemental carbon and particulate matter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM(2.5)) were measured at participating schools. Road and traffic densities were determine at schools and at each participant's house. Measurements and Main Results: In children with asthma, an inter-quartile increase in road density within the 50-, 100-, and 200-m home buffer areas was associated with increased exhaled NO (50 m: 28%; P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3-60; 100 m: 27%; P = 0.005; 95% Cl, 8-49; 200 m: 17%, P = 0.09, 95% Cl, -2 to 40), and reduced FEV(1) (50 m: -0.091 L; P = 0.038; 95% Cl, -0.174 to -0.007; 100 m: -0.072 L, P = -0.028, 95% Cl, -0.134 to -0.009; 200 in: -0.106L, P= 0.002,95%Cl, -0.171 to -0.041]). Exposure to NO(2) at schools was marginally associated with reduced FEV(1) (-0.020; P = 0.060; 95% Cl, -0.042 to 0.001). We did not observe significant associations with PM(2.5) or elemental carbon on exhaled NO. We did not observe significant reductions in lung volumes or changes in exhaled NO among healthy children. Conclusions: Vehicular traffic exposures are associated with increased levels of exhaled NO and reduced lung volumes in children with asthma.

Irritant gases and aerosols contaminating the air of indoor swimming pools can affect the lung epithelium and increase asthma risk in children. We evaluated the impact of infant swimming practice on allergic status and respiratory health later in childhood. Methods. Clara cell protein, surfactant-associated protein D, and total and aeroallergen-specific immunoglobulin E were measured in the serum of 341 schoolchildren aged 10 to 13 years, among whom 43 had followed an infant swimming program. Asthma was defined as doctor-diagnosed asthma and/or positive exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (15% decrease in postexercise forced expiratory volume). Results. There were no significant differences between the infant swimming group and the other children regarding the levels of exhaled nitric oxide and total or aeroallergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E. Children who swam as infants showed, by contrast, a significant decrease of serum Clara cell protein and of the serum Clara cell protein/surfactant-associated protein D ratio integrating Clara cell damage and permeability changes of the lung epithelial barrier. These effects were associated with higher risks of asthma and of recurrent bronchitis. Passive exposure to tobacco alone had no effect on these outcomes but seemed to interact with infant swimming practice to increase the risk of asthma or of recurrent bronchitis. Conclusions. Our data suggest that infant swimming practice in chlorinated indoor swimming pools is associated with airways changes that, along with other factors, seem to predispose children to the development of asthma and recurrent bronchitis.

Exposure to trichloramine and respiratory symptoms in indoor swimming pool workers	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						occupational asthma; swimming pools; trichloramines	NITROGEN TRICHLORIDE; ASTHMA; CHLORAMINES; CHLORINE; WATER; AIR	The association between swimming pool characteristics and activities of employees and respiratory symptoms in employees was studied. Trichloramine levels were measured to evaluate relationships with pool characteristics and to estimate long-term exposure levels. Questionnaires were available from 624 pool workers and 38 swimming facilities. Chloramine levels were measured by area sampling over 2-h periods and analysed using ion chromatography. Work-related and general respiratory symptoms, and symptoms indicatiive of atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were considered. Respiratory symptom prevalence among pool workers was compared with symptoms in a Dutch population sample. Chloramine levels were modelled with regression analysis. This model was used to estimate long-term average chloramine levels for each pool studied. Employees with higher exposure reported upper respiratory symptoms with greater frequency. Upper respiratory symptoms were statistically significantly associated with cumulative chloramine levels (odds ratio (OR) >1.4 for hoarseness, lost voice, sinusitis). General respiratory symptoms were significantly elevated compared with a Dutch population sample (OR ranged 1.4-7.2). An excess risk for respiratory symptoms indicative of asthma was observed in swimming pool employees. Aggravation of existing respiratory disease or interactions between irritants and allergen exposures are the most likely explanations for the observed associations.

Responses to ozone (O-3), an asthma trigger, are increased in obese (ob/ob) mice lacking the satiety hormone leptin. The long form of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) is required for satiety; mice lacking this receptor (db/db mice) are also substantially obese. Here, wild-type (WT) and db/db mice were exposed to air or O-3 (2 ppm) for 3 h. Airway responsiveness, measured by the forced oscillation technique, was greater in db/db than WT mice after air exposure. O-3-induced increases in pulmonary resistance and airway responsiveness were also greater in db/db mice. BALF eotaxin, IL-6, KC, and MIP-2 increased 4 h after O-3 exposure and subsided by 24 h, whereas protein and neutrophils continued to increase through 24 h. For each outcome, the effect of O-3 was significantly greater in db/db than WT mice. Previously published results obtained in ob/ob mice were similar except for O-3-induced neutrophils and MIP-2, which were not different from WT mice. O-3 also induced pulmonary IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in db/db but not ob/ob mice. Leptin was increased in serum of db/db mice, and pulmonary mRNA expression of short form of leptin receptor (Ob-R-a) was similar in db/db and WT mice. These data confirm obese mice have innate airway hyperresponsiveness and increased pulmonary responses to O-3. Differences between ob/ob mice, which lack leptin, and db/db mice, which lack Ob-Rb but not Ob-R-a, suggest leptin, acting through Ob-R-a, can modify some pulmonary responses to O-3.

This phenomenon, designated "acidopnea," has been attributed to airway inflammation. Objectives: To determine whether salivary acids and bases can influence EBC pH in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: Measurements were made of pH, electrolytes, and volatile bases and acids in saliva and EBC equilibrated with air in 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients. Results: The average EBC pH in COPD was reduced (normal, 7.24 +/- 0.24 SEM; range, 6.11-8.34; COPD, 6.67 +/- 0.18; range, 5.74-7.64; p = 0.079). EBCs were well buffered by NH4+/NH3 and CO2/HCO3- in all but four patients, who had NH4+ concentrations under 60 mu mol/L, and acetate concentrations that approached or exceeded those of NH4+. Saliva contained high concentrations of acetate (similar to 6,000 mu mol/L) and NH4+ (similar to 12,000 mu mol/L). EBC acetate increased and EBC NH4+ decreased when salivary pH was low, consistent with a salivary source for these volatile constituents. Nonvolatile acids did not play a significant role in determining pH of condensates because of extreme dilution of respiratory droplets by water vapor (similar to 1:12,000). Transfer of both acetic acid and NH3 from the saliva to the EBC was in the gas phase rather than droplets. bConclusions: EBC acidification in COPD can be affected by the balance of volatile salivary acids and bases, suggesting that EBC pH may not be a reliable marker of airway acidification. Salivary acidification may play an important role in acidopnea.

Over half of U.S. households have a source of NO2, and experimental data suggest potential for adverse respiratory effects. Objective: To examine associations of indoor NO2 exposure with respiratory symptoms among children with asthma. Methods: NO2 was measured using Palmes tubes, and respiratory symptoms in the month before sampling were collected during home interviews of mothers of 728 children with active asthma. All were younger than 12 yr, lived at the sampled home for at least 2 mo, and had asthma symptoms or used maintenance medication within the previous year. Measurements: Respiratory symptoms (wheeze, persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness). Results: Mean (SD) NO2 was 8.6 (9.1) ppb in homes with electric ranges and 25.9 (18.1) ppb in homes with gas stoves. In models stratified by housing type (a factor associated with socioeconomic status), gas stove presence and elevated NO2 were each significantly associated with respiratory symptoms, controlling for age, ethnicity, medication, mold/mildew, water leaks, and season of sampling. Among children in multifamily housing, exposure to gas stoves increased likelihood of wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 1.15, 4.47), shortness of breath (OR, 2.33; 95% Cl, 1.12, 5.06), and chest tightness (OR, 4.34; 95% Cl, 1.76, 10.69), whereas each 20-ppb increase in NO2 increased both likelihood of any wheeze (OR, 1.52; 95% Cl, 1.04, 2.21) or chest tightness (OR, 1.61; 95% Cl, 1.04, 2.49), and days of wheeze (rate ratio (RR), 1.33; 95% Cl, 1.05, 1.68) or chest tightness (RR, 1.51; 95% Cl, 1.18, 1.91). Conclusion: Exposure to indoor NO2 at levels well below the Environmental Protection Agency outdoor standard (53 ppb) is associated with respiratory symptoms among children with asthma in multifamily housing.

Most previous epidemiological studies used self-reported SHS exposure which could be biased by inaccurate reporting. In a prospective cohort study of adult nonsmokers recently admitted to hospital for asthma, the impact of SHS exposure on asthma health outcomes was examined. Methods: Recent SHS exposure during the previous 7 days was directly measured using a personal nicotine badge (n = 189) and exposure during the previous 3 months was estimated using hair nicotine and cotinine levels (n = 138). Asthma severity and health status were ascertained during telephone interviews, and subsequent admission to hospital for asthma was determined from computerised utilisation databases. Results: Most of the adults with asthma were exposed to SHS, with estimates ranging from 60% to 83% depending on the time frame and methodology. The highest level of recent SHS exposure, as measured by the personal nicotine badge, was related to greater asthma severity (mean score increment for highest tertile of nicotine level 1.56 points; 95% CI 0.18 to 2.95), controlling for sociodemographic covariates and previous smoking history. Moreover, the second and third tertiles of hair nicotine exposure during the previous month were associated with a greater baseline prospective risk of hospital admission for asthma (HR 3.73; 95% CI 1.04 to 13.30 and HR 3.61; 95% CI 1.0 to 12.9, respectively). Conclusions: Directly measured SHS exposure appears to be associated with poorer asthma outcomes. In public health terms, these results support efforts to prohibit smoking in public places.

We hypothesized that asthmatic individuals with higher levels of oxidative stress may have greater loss of SOD activity, which would be reflected systemically in loss of circulating SOD activity and clinically by development of severe asthma and/or worsening airflow limitation. Methods: To investigate this, serum SOD activity and proteins, the glutathione peroxidase/glutathione antioxidant system, and oxidatively modified amino acids were measured in subjects with asthma and healthy control subjects. Results: SOD activity, but not Mn-SOD or Cu,Zn-SOD protein, was lower in asthmatic serum as compared with control, and activity loss was significantly related to airflow limitation. Further, serum SOD activity demonstrated an inverse correlation with circulating levels of 3-bromotyrosine, a posttranslational modification of proteins produced by the eosinophil peroxidase system of eosinophils. Exposure of purified Cu,Zn-SOD to physiologically relevant levels of eosinophil peroxidase-generated reactive brominating species reactive nitrogen species, or tyrosyl radicals in vitro confirmed that eosinophil-derived oxidative pathways promote enzyme inactivation. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with greater oxidant stress in asthma leading to greater inactivation of SOD, which likely amplifies inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction.

The contribution of other fungal genera plus airborne fungal hyphae and fragmented conidia to allergic diseases is poorly understood. Objective: We sought to investigate the expression of allergens from airborne wild-type fungi using the Halogen immunoassay, which uses allergic serum IgE to immunostain immobilized allergens extracted from individual fungal particles. Methods: Airborne fungi were collected onto mixed cellulose ester protein-binding membranes for 2.5 hours with volumetric air pumps. Collected fungi were incubated overnight in a humid chamber to promote the germination of conidia. The membranes were laminated with an adhesive cover slip and immunostained with an Altentaria species-sensitive serum IgE pool. The samples were examined by means of light microscopy, and positively immunostained fungal particles were classified and counted. Results: All air samples contained fungal hyphae that expressed soluble allergens and were significantly higher in concentration than counts of conidia of individual well-ebaracterized allergenic genera (P &LT; .05). Resultant immunostaining of fungal hyphae was heterogeneous, and approximately 25% of all hyphae expressed detectable allergen compared with nonstained hyphae (P &LT; .05). Fungal conidia of 10 genera that were previously uncharacterized as allergen sources were shown to demonstrate IgE binding to expressed antigens and accounted for 8% of the total airborne conidia count. Conclusions: Our analysis of wild-type fungi collected indoors presents a new paradigm of natural fungal exposure, which, in addition to commonly recognized species, implicates airborne hyphae, fragmented conidia, and the conidia of a much more diverse range of genera as airborne allergens.

There are no prospective studies on RSV infection starting from infancy progressing through childhood into adulthood. We followed up a cohort of children, hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis or RSV pneumonia before age 24 months, until age 18-20 years. The aim of the study was to evaluate early RSV infection as a risk factor for asthma, bronchial reactivity, and lung function abnormalities in young adults. The participants filled in a questionnaire on asthma and asthma-like symptoms. The clinical study included flow-volume spirometry (FVS), methacholine inhalation challenge (MIC), home PEF (peak expiratory flow) monitoring, and skin prick tests (SPT) to common allergens. Asthma was present in 17-22% of 36 index subjects, depending on asthma definition, compared to 11% of 45 controls. Furthermore, FEV% and MEF25 were lower, and MEF50 tended to be lower, in index than in control subjects. One or more abnormal lung function results were found in 16 (44%) index subjects, but only in 5 (11%) controls (P < 0.01). Bronchial reactivity (PD20 <4,900 mug methacholine) was demonstrated in 16 (46%) index subjects and 14 (32%) controls (NS). At least one positive SPT result was present in 21 (60%) index subjects; 6 (29%) had asthma (NS vs. nonatopic index subjects); 13 (62%) had abnormal lung function (P < 0.05); and 14 (67%) had bronchial reactivity (P < 0.01). In the logistic regression adjusted for atopy, as defined by SPT positivity, RSV infection in infancy was an independent risk factor for lung function abnormality (one or more abnormal results in FVS; OR, 5.27; 95% Cl, 1.6017.36), and also for decreased FEV% and MEF50 when these were analyzed separately. However, RSV infection in infancy was not a significant risk factor for asthma or bronchial reactivity. In young adults, lung function abnormalities may be associated with RSV infection which required hospitalization in infancy. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children umbilical cord samples were assayed for trace elements and minerals, and mothers were asked about wheezing and eczema in their children. Associations of cord concentrations of selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, iron, lead and mercury with wheezing at 30-42 months, with wheezing patterns defined by the presence or absence of transient infant, later onset or persistent wheezing at 0-6 months and 30-42 months, respectively (n=2,044), and with eczema at 18-30 months (n=2,173), were analysed. Cord selenium was negatively associated with persistent wheeze (adjusted odds ratio (OR) per doubling concentration: 0.67). Cord iron was negatively associated with later onset wheeze (OR: 0.86) and with eczema (OR: 0.90). Children with high cord concentrations of selenium and iron were less likely than those with low concentrations to wheeze transiently in infancy. The level of foetal exposure to selenium and iron may possibly influence the risk of wheezing and eczema in early childhood although, in view of the multiple analyses carried out, it is possible that the main findings occurred by chance.

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway triggers the inflammatory responses induced by LPS in a process that requires the interaction of LPS-bound myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2) with TLR4. Here we propose two possible mechanisms for LPS recognition and signalling that take into account both the structural information available for TLR4 and MD-2, and the determinants of endotoxicity, namely, the acylation and phosphorylation patterns of LIPS. In our first model, LPS induces the association of two TLR4-MD-2 heterodimers by binding to two different molecules of MD-2 through the acyl chains of lipid A. In our second model, the binding of LPS to a single TLR4-MD-2 complex facilitates the recruitment of a second TLR4-MD-2 heterodimer. These models contrast with the activation of Drosophila Toll, where the receptor is crosslinked by a dimeric protein ligand.

From the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted in the United States between 1988 and 1994, the authors selected 4,093 children (aged 6-17 years) for whom relevant medical, socioeconomic, and anthropometric data were complete. The children were 50.6% female, and 9.7% reported a diagnosis of asthma. Bivariate analyses showed that asthma diagnosis was associated with lower levels of serum vitamin C, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. However, antioxidant levels may be surrogate markers for socioeconomic variables such as race, poverty, tobacco exposure, or general nutritional status. In logistic models that included age, body mass index, socioeconomic variables, antioxidant levels, parental asthma, and household smoking, the only antioxidants significantly associated with asthma were vitamin C (odds ratio = 0.72 per mg/dl, 95% confidence interval = 0.55, 0.95) and alpha-carotene (odds ratio = 0.95 per mug/dl, 95% confidence interval = 0.90, 0.99). The odds ratio for asthma in the highest quintile of serum vitamin C relative to the lowest was 0.65 (p < 0.05), whereas it was 0.74 for &alpha;-carotene (p = 0.066). The authors concluded that low vitamin C and &alpha;-carotene intakes are associated with asthma risk in children.

Tropomyosin is a major allergen in many shellfish, especially crustacea and mollusks. Interestingly, tropomyosin has also been identified as an important allergen in other invertebrates including dust mites and cockroaches, and it has been proposed by some to be an invertebrate pan allergen. Different regions of shrimp tropomyosin bind IgE; 5 major IgE-binding regions have been identified in shrimp tropomyosin containing 8 epitopes. Mutations of these shrimp allergenic epitopes can reduce seafood allergenicity; methods utilizing such mutations will provide safer vaccines for more effective treatment of seafood-allergic patients, and in the future less-allergenic seafood products for consumption.

This disease is associated with an increase in the number of Th2 (T helper type 2) cells and Th2 cytokines and a decrease in the number of Th1 (T helper type 1) cells and Th1 cytokines. Histamine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma through differential regulation of T helper lymphocytes. Histamine enhances the secretion of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 (interleukin-4), IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and inhibits the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFNgamma (interferon-gamma)and monokine IL-12. It has been shown that histamine can modulate the cytokine network through upregulation of PGE(2) (prostaglandin E-2) and NO (nitric oxide). Histamine also affects cytokine production via H2 receptors and through the activation of PKA (protein kinase A). We have also demonstrated that the Jak-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway is involved in histamine-mediated regulation of Th2 cytokines IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and Th1 cytokine IFNgamma. While standard treatment of asthma consists of beta-receptor agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, the elucidation of histamine's control over the cytokine network and the Th1/Th2 balance provides a basis for the potential use of antihistamines in the prevention and treatment of atopic asthma. Several other anti-allergic agents to modulate the Th1/Th2 balance are under current investigation based on this paradigm. These include cytokines, cytokine antagonists, anti-IgE, and vaccinations. As more advances are made in our understanding of histamine and its control over the Th1/Th2 balance, the use of new therapeutic targets such as these will play a prominent role in disease management.

This study explored the use of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles for oral immunisation to induce immune responses specific to both the left and right domains of Der p 1. DNA constructs pDer p 1 (1-222) and pDer p 1 (114-222) were complexed with chitosan and delivered orally followed by an i.m. injection of pDer p 1 (1-222) 13 weeks later. Such approach has successfully primed Th1-skewed immune responses against both domains of Der p 1. This strategy could be further optimised for more efficacious gene vaccination for full length Der p 1. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The first test to be developed was exercise and it was used to assess the efficacy of drugs such as sodium cromoglycate. Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea was developed later, as a surrogate test for exercise. Hypertonic aerosols were introduced to mimic the dehydrating effects of evaporative water loss that occurs during hyperpnea. A wet aerosol of 4.5% saline or a dry powder formulation of mannitol is used. At present the indirect challenge tests are becoming increasingly recognised as appropriate for monitoring treatment with inhaled steroids. Indirect tests identify those with potential for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, an important problem for some occupations, such as the defence forces, fire fighters and the police force and for some athletic activities. The advantage in using an indirect challenges, over a direct challenge with a single pharmacological agonist, is that a positive response indicates that inflammatory cells and their mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and histamine) are present in the airways in sufficient numbers and concentration to indicate that asthma is active at the time of testing. The corollary to this is that a negative test in a known asthmatic indicates good control or mild disease. Another advantage is that healthy subjects do not have significant airway narrowing to indirect challenge tests. The protocols used for challenge with indirectly acting stimuli are presented in detail.

With this material, we attempted to produce an animal model of the atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS). Methods: We cultured Df mites in high density and prepared a crude extract of Df (DfE) together with the culture medium. We applied the extract to the back skin of NC/Nga and BALB/c mice three times per week for 8 weeks. Results: In the NC/Nga group, dryness or scaling appeared on the skin, and scratching behavior increased at the second week in the DfE-treated group. Skin erosion and hemorrhage occurred at the fourth week. The epidermis thickened and deepened into the upper dermis, in which mast cells were highly accumulated, corresponding with the skin lesion of AEDS patients. Specific IgE and IgG to DfE and total IgE were elevated in the sera. Mice treated with an extract of mite culture medium did not develop skin lesions. In the BALB/c group, mice developed specific IgE and IgG to DfE, however, no typical skin lesions appeared. Mast cells in the upper dermis did not increase. Conclusions: Repeated painting of Dermatophagoides extract produced IgE-associated AEDS-like lesions on the skin of NC mice.

Inhaled glucocorticoids decrease exhaled NO concentration, but the relative contributions of alveolar and bronchial levels to the decrease in exhaled NO concentration are unknown. Alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux can be separately approximated by measuring exhaled NO at several exhalation flow rates. The effect of steroid treatment on alveolar and bronchial NO output in asthma was studied. Alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux were assessed in 16 patients with asthma before and during treatment with inhaled fluticasone for 8 weeks and in 16 healthy controls. Before the treatment, asthmatics had increased bronchial NO flux (mean +/- SEM: 3.6 +/-0.4 versus 0.7 +/-0.1 nL.s(-1), p<0.001) but normal alveolar NO concentration (1.2<plus/minus>0.5 versus 1.0 +/-0.2 parts per billion (ppb), p>0.05) compared with controls Inhaled fluticasone decreased bronchial NO flux from 3.6 +/-0.4 to 0.7 +/-0.1 nL.s(-1)(p<0.01) but had no effect on alveolar NO concentration (before: 1.2<plus/minus>0.5; after: 1.2 +/-0.1 ppb, p>0.05). The forced expiratory volume in one second improved, whereas asthma symptom score and serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil protein X decreased during the treatment. In conclusion, inhaled fluticasone decreases bronchial but not alveolar nitric oxide output simultaneously with clinical improvement in patients with asthma.

To collect data on hospitalization rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness during the season of 1999 to 2000 in nonprophylaxed premature infants less than or equal to 32 weeks gestational age (GA) in Spain and compare this with previously published data collected in the season of 1998 to 1999. Methods. Children born at less than or equal to 32 weeks GA between April 1, 1999, and April 31, 2000, and discharged from the hospital before April 31, 2000, were included. Neonatal and demographic data were obtained at the initial visit. Study subjects were followed at monthly intervals throughout the respiratory season. RSV status and morbidity data were collected on patients rehospitalized for respiratory illness. Results. The 999 evaluable patients in the 2000 season were comparable to the 1999 sample, except for higher rates of family allergy history and number of multiple deliveries and a lower rate of neonatal morbidity. The hospitalization rate for RSV illness was 13.4% in the 1999 season and 13.1% in the 2000 season; 10 (8%) were RSV reinfections in the 2000 season. Significant independent prognostic variables for high risk of RSV hospital admission included: lower gestational age; chronologic age <3 months at onset of the RSV season; living with school age siblings; and exposure to tobacco smoke. Conclusions. Hospitalization rates for RSV disease in nonprophylaxed preterm infants less than or equal to 32 weeks GA were high in Spain and comparable during two consecutive RSV seasons (13%). Readmission for a second RSV infection was also common.

Design: A postal survey. Setting: The municipality of Orebro, Sweden. Participants: A total of 8,008 randomly selected inhabitants aged 15 to 69 years. Measurements: Exposures, airway symptoms, and respiratory history were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: The response rate was 84%. In never-smokers with childhood ETS exposure, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 7.6% vs 5.9% in nonexposed subjects (p = 0.036). In never-smokers without a family history of asthma, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma in subjects reporting childhood ETS exposure was 6.8% vs 3.8% in nonexposed subjects (p < 0.001). Subjects with childhood ETS exposure were more likely to start smoking in adulthood. The prevalence of ever-smokers was 54.5% vs 33.8% (p < 0.0001) in nonexposed subjects. ETS was the most commonly reported LAWI in the total sample (21%), followed by exercise in cold air (20%); dust (19%), exercise (16%), perfume (15%), cold air (12%), pollen (10%), and pets (8%). All LAWIs were more frequently reported by women. Conclusions: Childhood exposure to ETS is associated with an increased prevalence of asthma among adult never-smokers, especially in nonatopic subjects. Children exposed to ETS are also more likely to become smokers. ETS is as a major LAWI.

Objective: To describe severity of asthma, allergy skin test sensitivities, indoor allergen exposures, and the impact on quality of life (QOL) and health status in elderly persons with asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional data analysis with 80 elderly persons with asthma recruited from medical, geriatric, and allergy/immunology tertiary care centers. Asthma severity was determined by symptoms and measurements of lung function. House dust specimens were collected from mattresses and bedroom carpets and analyzed separately for the major allergens of house dust, using monoclonal antibody-based immunoenzymetric assays. QOL was measured using Juniper's Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. Health status was measured using the Short Form Health Survey Medical Outcome Questionnaire which included Ferrans and Powers' Quality of Life Index subscales. Results: Two-thirds of participants had either moderate or severe persistent asthma. Skin tests to a battery of common airborne allergens were positive to at least one allergen in 56 of the 75 participants tested (74.7%). Reservoir dust allergen levels were often high enough to place participants at risk of symptoms or at risk of developing sensitization. Increased asthma severity was associated with significantly lower QOL and a trend toward decreased health status. Conclusions: Asthma is a significant chronic problem in the elderly. Atopy was common. Asthma severity impacts on these participants' QOL and health status. Results support interventions aimed at identifying allergens precipitating attacks and reducing them in the home.

The raw data for such studies, including disease cases, environmental pollution concentrations, and the reference population at risk, are typically measured at various levels of spatial aggregation but are accumulated to a common geographical scale to facilitate statistical analysis. In this traditional approach, heterogeneous exposure distributions within the aggregate areas may lead to biased inference, whereas individual attributes such as age, gender, and smoking habits must either be summarized to provide area-level covariate values or used to stratify the analysis. This article presents a spatial regression analysis of the effect of traffic pollution on respiratory disorders in children. The analysis features data measured at disparate, nonnested scales, including spatially varying covariates, latent spatially varying risk factors, and case-specific individual attributes. The problem of disparate discretizations is overcome by relating all spatially varying quantities to a continuous underlying random field model. Case-specific individual attributes are accommodated by treating cases as a marked point process. Inference in these hierarchical Poisson/gamma models is based on simulated samples drawn from Bayesian posterior distributions, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with data augmentation.

Studies of airway smooth muscle cells in culture have shown that many mitogenic mediators can induce proliferation, and that these may therefore, contribute to the increase in airway smooth muscle mass observed in asthma. Other mechanisms for airway smooth muscle proliferation include the interaction with inflammatory cells such as T-cells and eosinophils. Airway smooth muscle cells may also be a source of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, in particular chemokines, thus implicating airway smooth muscle cells as contributors to the inflammatory mechanisms of asthma. The pro-activating signals for converting airway smooth muscle cells into a proliferative and secretory cell in asthma are unknown, but may include viruses and immunoglobulin E. Airway smooth muscle contractility may also be altered in response to inflammation. Airway smooth muscle cells may play an important interactive role with inflammatory and other structural cells, contributing to inflammation, injury and repair of the airways.

The process by which low molecular weight chemicals induce and elicit skin sensitization reactions is complex and dependent on many factors relevant to the ability of the chemical to penetrate the skin, react with protein, and trigger the cell-mediated immune response. These major factors include inherent potency, chemical dose, duration and frequency of exposure, vehicle or product matrix, and occlusion. The fact that a chemical is a contact allergen does not mean that it cannot be formulated into a consumer product at levels well tolerated by most individuals. Many common ingredients (e.g., fragrances, preservatives) are known skin allergens. However, all allergens show dose-response and threshold characteristics. Therefore, one should be able to incorporate these chemicals into products at levels that produce acceptably low incidences of skin sensitization under foreseeable conditions of exposure. The critical exposure determinant for evaluating skin sensitization risk is dose per unit area of skin exposed. Use of this parameter allows for comparative assessments from different types of skin sensitization tests (including cross-species comparisons), and, at least for known potent allergens, there is remarkable similarity in threshold dose/unit area determinations across species. The dose/unit area calculation enables a judgment of the sensitization risk for different product types. This is illustrated using the chemical preservative methylchloroisothiazoline/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) as a case study.

A cohort of 237 infants (106 females: 131 males) was evaluated, and 496 lung function measurements were made between the ages of 1-12 months. Respiratory function was assessed using the rapid thoracic compression technique to obtain maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (V'maxFRC). Parental history of asthma and smoking habits during pregnancy were obtained by questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a longitudinal random effects model. infants with a parental history of asthma and/or in utero passive smoke exposure were compared to a reference group of infants who had no parental history of asthma and in whom neither parent smoked pre- or postnatally. Boys were found to have a consistently lower V'maxFRC (-21.05 mL.s(-1)) throughout the first year of life in comparison to girls (P < 0.05). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with a lower V'maxFRG in both genders in comparison to unexposed infants (P < 0.05). V'maxFRC was unaffected by parental history of asthma. Gender-specific normative equations for V'maxFRC throughout the first year of life were derived for the infant cohort as a whole and also for subgroups of infants, based on parental asthma and smoking history. We conclude that lung function during the first year of life differs between genders and is adversely affected by in utero passive tobacco smoke exposure.

Among all phenotypes described, there are three that are associated with prognosis and especially are associated with a different response to currently available therapies. There phenotypes are: the exacerbator, the overlap COPD-asthma and the emphysema-hyperinflation. The exacerbator is characterised by the presence of, at least, two exacerbations the previous year, and on top of long-acting bronchodilators, may require the use of antiinflammatory drugs. The overlap phenotype presents symptoms of increased variability of airflow and incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. Due to the underlying inflammatory profile, it uses to have a good therapeutic response to inhaled corticosteroids in addition to bronchodilators. Lastly, the emphysema phenotype presents a poor therapeutic response to the existing antiinflammatory drugs and long-acting bronchodilators together with rehabilitation are the treatments of choice. Identifying the peculiarities of the different phenotypes of COPD will allow us to implement a more personalised treatment, in which the characteristics of the patients, together with their severity will be key to choose the best treatment option.

The desert climate of Tucson offers a unique setting for studying the health effects of higher exposure to vitamin D. Objective: To assess the relationship between cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and allergic outcomes through age 5 years. Methods: Cord blood 25(OH)D levels were measured in 219 participants in the Tucson Infant Immune Study, a population-based birth cohort. Plasma total IgE and specific IgE levels to 6 aeroallergens were measured at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years. Skin prick test (SPT) positivity (wheal diameter >= 3 mm) and physician-diagnosed active allergic rhinitis and asthma were assessed at age 5 years. Longitudinal models were used to assess the relationship between 25(OH)D and IgE levels. Logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship of 25(OH)D level with SPT positivity, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Results: The median cord blood 25(OH)D level was 64 nmol/L (interquartile range, 49-81 nmol/L). Relative to the reference group (50-74.9 nmol/L), both low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>= 100 nmol/L) levels were associated with increased total IgE (coefficient = 0.27, P = .006 and coefficient = 0.27, P = .04, respectively) and detectable inhalant allergen-specific IgE (odds ratio = 2.4, P = .03 and odds ratio = 4.0, P = .01, respectively) through age 5 years. High 25(OH)D levels were also associated with increased SPT positivity (odds ratio = 4.0, P = .02). By contrast, the 25(OH)D level was not significantly associated with allergic rhinitis or asthma. Conclusion: Both low and high levels of cord blood 25(OH)D were associated with increased aeroallergen sensitization. The association between vitamin D status and actual allergic diseases merits further study. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:1093-9.)

Besides selective physical conditions, the epithelium is regularly replaced and covered with a protective mucus layer trapping immune molecules. Recent insights into host defense strategies show that the host selects the intestinal microbiota, particularly the mucosa-associated microbial community. In this context, humans coevolved with thousands of intestinal microbial species that have adapted to provide host benefits, while avoiding pathogenic behavior that might destabilize their host interaction. While mucosal microorganisms would be crucial for immunological priming, luminal microorganisms would be important for nutrient digestion. Further, we propose that the intestinal microorganisms also coevolved with each other, leading to coherently organized, resilient microbial associations. During disturbances, functionally redundant members become more abundant and are crucial for preserving community functionality. The outside of the mucus layer, where host defense molecules are more diluted, could serve as an environment where microorganisms are protected from disturbances in the lumen and from where they can recolonize the lumen after perturbations. This might explain the remarkable temporal stability of microbial communities. Finally, commensals that become renegade or a decreased exposure to essential coevolved microorganisms may cause particular health problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity or allergies.

Acute effects of air pollution on pediatric asthma exacerbation: Evidence of association and effect modification	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Air pollution; Asthma; Children; Desert dust; Time-series	4 EUROPEAN CITIES; TIME-SERIES; EMERGENCY ADMISSIONS; CASE-CROSSOVER; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; VISITS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; PROJECT	We investigated the short-term effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu g/m(3) (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) on pediatric asthma emergency admissions in Athens, Greece over the period 2001-2004. We explored effect modification patterns by season, sex, age and by the presence of desert dust transported mainly from the Sahara area. We used daily time-series data provided by the children's hospitals and the fixed monitoring stations. The associations were investigated using Poisson regression models controlling for seasonality, weather, influenza episodes, day of the week and holiday effects. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10, was associated with a 2.54% increase (95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.06%, 5.08%) in the number of pediatric asthma hospital admissions, while the same increase in SO2 was associated with a 5.98% (95% Cl: 0.88%, 11.33%) increase. O-3 was associated with a statistically significant increase in asthma admissions among older children in the summer. Our findings provide limited evidence of an association between NO2 exposure and asthma exacerbation. Statistically significant PM10 effects were higher during winter and during desert dust days, while SO2 effects occurred mainly during spring. Our study confirms previously reported PM10 effects on emergency hospital admissions for pediatric asthma and further provides evidence of stronger effects during desert dust days. We additionally report severe effects of SO2, even at today's low concentration levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Personal Exposures to Traffic-Related Air Pollution and Acute Respiratory Health among Bronx Schoolchildren with Asthma	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						pollution; asthma; children's health; diesel; elemental carbon; personal monitoring traffic; PM2.5	EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE; LUNG-FUNCTION; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; SOUTH BRONX; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION; PARTICULATE; SYMPTOMS; INFLAMMATION; COMMUNITIES	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported relationships between adverse respiratory health outcomes and residential proximity to traffic pollution, but have not shown this at a personal exposure level. OBJECTIVE: We compared, among inner-city children with asthma, the associations of adverse asthma outcome incidences with increased personal exposure to particulate matter mass <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) air pollution versus the diesel-related carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5. METHODS: Daily 24-hr personal samples of PM2.5, including the elemental carbon (EC) fraction, were collected for 40 fifth-grade children with asthma at four South Bronx schools (10 children per school) during approximately 1 month each. Spirometry and symptom scores were recorded several times daily during weekdays. RESULTS: We found elevated same-day relative risks of wheeze [1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.04)], shortness of breath (1.41; 95% CI, 1.01-1.99), and total symptoms (1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62) with an increase in personal EC, but not with personal PM2.5 mass. We found increased risk of cough, wheeze, and total symptoms with increased 1-day lag and 2-day average personal and school-site EC. We found no significant associations with school-site PM2.5 mass or sulfur. The EC effect estimate was robust to addition of gaseous pollutants. CONCLUSION: Adverse health associations were strongest with personal measures of EC exposure, suggesting that the diesel "soot" fraction of PM2.5 is most responsible for pollution-related asthma exacerbations among children living near roadways. Studies that rely on exposure to PM mass may underestimate PM health impacts.

It has already had an impact on living organisms, including plants and fungi with current scenarios projecting further effects by the end of the century. Over the last three decades, studies have shown changes in production, dispersion and allergen content of pollen and spores, which may be region- and species-specific. In addition, these changes may have been influenced by urban air pollutants interacting directly with pollen. Data suggest an increasing effect of aeroallergens on allergic patients over this period, which may also imply a greater likelihood of the development of an allergic respiratory disease in sensitized subjects and exacerbation of symptomatic patients. There are a number of limitations that make predictions uncertain, and further and specifically designed studies are needed to clarify current effects and future scenarios. We recommend: More stress on pollen/spore exposure in the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of respiratory and allergic diseases; collection of aerobiological data in a structured way at the European level; creation, promotion and support of multidisciplinary research teams in this area; lobbying the European Union and other funders to finance this research.

FA is the consequence of maladaptive immune responses to common and otherwise innocuous food antigens. Concurrent with the increase in FA is an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) caused by several factors, especially decreased sunlight/UVB exposure. There is growing appreciation of the importance of the pleiotropic hormone vitamin D in the development of tolerance, immune system defenses, and epithelial barrier integrity. We propose a "multiplehit'' model in which VDD in a developmentally critical period increases susceptibility to colonization with abnormal intestinal microbial flora and gastrointestinal infections, contributing to abnormal intestinal barrier permeability and excess and inappropriate exposure of the immune system to dietary allergens. A compounding effect (and additional "hit'') of VDD is the promotion of a pro-sensitization immune imbalance that might compromise immunologic tolerance and contribute to FA. We propose that early correction of VDD might promote mucosal immunity, healthy microbial ecology, and allergen tolerance and thereby blunt the FA epidemic in children.

Currently in the UK, approximately one quarter of the population suffers from seasonal allergic rhinitis. Most patients can be treated with conventional pharmacotherapy on an 'as needed' symptomatic basis whereas allergen immunotherapy represents a useful treatment approach in carefully selected patients with severe, IgE-mediated disease. Allergen immunotherapy can deliver improvements in hayfever symptoms over and above that which can be achieved by pharmacotherapy. In addition, unlike pharmacotherapy, allergen immunotherapy provides long-term clinical benefits. These include long-term disease remission, prevention of new atopic sensitisations and a reduction in disease progression from rhinitis to asthma. This review provides a comprehensive update on the mechanisms of allergen injection immunotherapy, recent data on the mechanisms of sublingual allergen immunotherapy is also included.	[James, L.

Chronic exposure to beta-blockers attenuates inflammation and mucin content in a murine asthma model	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						beta-blockers; beta-adrenoceptor; asthma; mucin; airway inflammation	HEART-FAILURE; ADRENERGIC-BLOCKADE; AIRWAY MUCUS; GOBLET CELL; OVEREXPRESSION; ABNORMALITIES; EXPRESSION; BUCINDOLOL; SECRETION; MICE	Single-dose administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists produces bronchodilation and inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and is the standard treatment for the acute relief of asthma. However, chronic repetitive administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists may increase AHR, airway inflammation, and risk of death. Based upon the paradigm shift that occurred with the use of beta-blockers in congestive heart failure, we previously determined that chronic administration of beta-blockers decreased AHR in a murine model of asthma. To elucidate the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers, we examined the effects of chronic administration of several beta-adrenoceptor ligands in a murine model of allergic asthma. Administration of beta-blockers resulted in a reduction in total cell counts, eosinophils, and the cytokines IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, and TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and attenuated epithelial mucin content and morphologic changes. The differences in mucin content also occurred if the beta-blockers were administered only during the ovalbumin challenge phase, but administration of beta-blockers for 7 days was not as effective as administration for 28 days. These results indicate that in a murine model of asthma, chronic administration of beta-blockers reduces inflammation and mucous metaplasia, cardinal features of asthma that may contribute to airflow obstruction and AHR. Similar to heart failure, our results provide a second disease model in which beta-blockers producing an acutely detrimental effect may provide a therapeutically beneficial effect with chronic administration.

Previous research on health and indoor environments has tended to concentrate on discrete pollutant sources and exposures and on specific disease processes. Recently, efforts have been made to characterize more fully the complex interactions between the health of occupants and the interior spaces they inhabit. In this article we review recent advances in source characterization, exposure assessment, health effects associated with indoor exposures, and intervention research related to indoor environments. Advances in source characterization include a better understanding of how chemicals are transported and processed within spaces and the role that other factors such as lighting and building design may play in determining health. Efforts are under way to improve our ability to measure exposures, but this remains a challenge, particularly for biological agents. Researchers are also examining the effects of multiple exposures as well as the effects of exposures on vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. In addition, a number of investigators are also studying the effects of modifying building design, materials, and operations on occupant health. Identification of research priorities should include input from building designers, operators, and the public health community.

Background.-The American Migraine Study II estimates that 28 million Americans suffer from migraine headache. The majority of these patients remain undiagnosed and many are erroneously diagnosed as having sinus headache. Despite this common diagnosis, the concept of sinus headache remains an enigma with a relative paucity of information in the literature. Methods.-Advertising in the greater Phoenix, U.S. metropolitan area was used to recruit 100 willing and consecutive subjects to participate in this descriptive clinical study (The Sinus, Allergy and Migraine Study [SAMS]). All patients who believed they suffered from sinus headache and were over 18 years of age were enrolled without exclusion. A detailed history and exam was performed in each patient, and patients were given headache diagnoses based on the current International Headache Society's (IHS) criteria. Results.-Of the 100 subjects with self-diagnosed headache, IHS diagnoses mistaken as sinus headache included migraine with or without aura (52%), chronic migraine associated with medication overuse versus probable medication overuse headache (11%), probable migraine (23%), cluster headache (1%), hemicrania continua (1%), headache secondary to rhinosinusitis (3%), and headaches nonclassifiable (9%). Weather changes (83%), seasonal variation (73%), exposure to allergens (62%), and changes in altitude (38%) were frequent migraine triggers. Seventy-six percent of migraine subjects reported pain in the distribution of the second division of the trigeminal nerve (either unilateral or bilateral), and 62% experienced bilateral forehead and maxillary pain with their headaches. The most common associated features included nasal congestion (56%), eyelid edema (37%), rhinorrhea (25%), conjunctival injection (22%), lacrimation (19%), and ptosis (3%). The headaches nonclassifiable were characterized by a bilateral maxillary pressure of mild to moderate intensity associated with at least one cranial autonomic symptom. Features suggestive of migraine were absent in all 9 of these nonclassifiable cases. Conclusions.-The majority of those with self-diagnosed sinus headache have migraine or probable migraine. In those patients with migraine, the most common reasons for misdiagnosis include headache triggers, pain location, and associated features ("guilt by provocation, location, and association") commonly attributed to sinus headache. The clinician must be aware of these unique presentations of migraine so that a correct diagnosis can be made and effective treatment instituted. A portion of patients with self-diagnosed sinus headache suffer from a headache type, which is unclassifiable by the current IHS criteria. These headaches are characterized by bilateral maxillary pressure, mild to moderate pain intensity, cranial autonomic symptoms, and the complete absence of migraine features.

The balance between allergen-specific T-regulatory (Treg) cells and T helper 2 cells appears to be decisive in the development of allergic and healthy immune response against allergens. Treg cells consistently represent the dominant subset specific for common environmental allergens in healthy individuals. In contrast, there is a high frequency of allergen-specific T helper 2 cells in allergic individuals. A decrease in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 production by allergen-specific CD4(+) T cells due to the induction of peripheral T cell tolerance is the most essential step in allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT). Suppressed proliferative and cytokine responses against the major allergens are induced by multiple suppressor factors, such as cytokines like IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and cell surface molecules like cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, programmed death-1 and histamine receptor 2. There is considerable rationale for targeting T cells to increase efficacy of SIT. Such novel approaches include the use of modified allergens produced using recombinant DNA technology and adjuvants or additional drugs, which may increase the generation of allergen-specific peripheral tolerance. By the application of the recent knowledge in Treg cells and related mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, more rational and safer approaches are awaiting for the future of prevention and cure of allergic diseases.

This article reviews the data for the role of CysLTs as multi-functional mediators in allergic rhinitis (AR). We review the evidence that: (1) CysLTs are released from inflammatory cells that participate in AR, (2) receptors for CysLTs are located in nasal tissue, (3) CysLTs are increased in patients with AR and are released following allergen exposure, (4) administration of CysLTs reproduces the symptoms of AR, (5) CysLTs play roles in the maturation, as well as tissue recruitment, of inflammatory cells, and (6) a complex inter-regulation between CysLTs and a variety of other inflammatory mediators exists.

A total of 198 cases (with at least two of three symptoms: wheezing, rhinitis, eczema) and 202 healthy controls, living in 390 homes, were examined by physicians. Ventilation rates were measured by a passive tracer gas method, and inspections were carried out in the homes. About 60% of the multi-family houses and about 80% of the single-family houses did not fulfill the minimum requirement regarding ventilation rate in the Swedish building code (0.5 air changes per hour, ach). Cases had significantly lower ventilation rates than controls and a dose-response relationship was indicated.

Reinfection is common at all ages, but factors that determine the development of altered airway function after reinfection are not well understood. This study was conducted in a mouse model to define the role of age in determining the consequences on airway function after reinfection. Mice were infected shortly after birth or at weaning and were reinfected 5 wk later, followed by assessment of airway function, airway inflammation, and lung histopathology. Infection of mice at weaning elicited a protective airway response upon reinfection. In this age group, reinfection resulted in increased airway inflammation, but without development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) or eosinophilia and decreased IL-13 levels. By contrast, neonatal infection failed to protect the airways and resulted in enhanced AHR after reinfection. This secondary response was associated with the development of airway eosinophilia, increased IL-13 levels, and mucus hyperproduction. Both CD4- and CD8-positive T cells were a source of IL-13 in the lung, and inhibition of IL-13 abolished AHR and mucus production in these mice. Inoculation of UV-inactivated virus failed to elicit these divergent responses to reinfection, emphasizing the requirement for active lung infection during initial exposure. Thus, neonatal RSV infection predisposes to the development of airway eosinophilia and enhanced AHR via an IL-13-dependent mechanism during reinfection, whereas infection at a later age protects against the development of these altered airway responses after reinfection.

Dietary restrictions in pregnancy are not recommended. Avoiding inhalant allergens during pregnancy has not been shown to reduce allergic disease, and is not recommended. Breastfeeding should be recommended because of other beneficial effects, but if breast feeding is not possible, a hydrolysed formula is recommended (rather than conventional cow's milk formulas) in high-risk infants only. Maternal dietary restrictions during breastfeeding are not recommended. Soy formulas and other formulas (eg, goat's milk) are not recommended for reducing food allergy risk. Complementary foods (including normal cow's milk formulas) should be delayed until a child is aged at least 4-6 months, but a preventive effect from this measure has only been demonstrated in high-risk infants. There is no evidence that an elimination diet after age 4-6 months has a protective effect, although this needs additional investigation. Further research is needed to determine the relationship between house dust mite exposure at an early age and the development of sensitisation and disease; no recommendation can yet be made about avoidance measures for preventing allergic disease. No recommendations can be made about exposure to pets in early life and the development of allergic disease. If a family already has pets it is not necessary to remove them, unless the child develops evidence of pet allergy (as assessed by an allergy specialist). Women should be advised not to smoke while pregnant, and parents should be advised not to smoke. No recommendations can be made on the use of probiotic supplements (or other microbial agents) for preventing allergic disease at this time. Immunotherapy may be considered as a treatment option for children with allergic rhinitis, and may prevent the subsequent development of asthma.

Only a minority of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) are allergic in origin and will reappear after the next exposure. Methods to confirm suspected CADRs are needed and skin testing could serve as one possibility. Objectives To analyse the usefulness of skin tests in revealing drug allergy. The relevance of skin test results was evaluated with drug provocation studies. Methods During 1989-2001, 947 patients with a history of suspected CADR were examined with skin tests including patch tests (PTs) (826 patients), skin prick tests (SPTs) (935 patients) and photopatch tests (12 patients). The occurrence of positive and negative test reactions to different drugs was correlated with clinical history. Drug provocation was carried out in 246 patients. Results Antimicrobial drugs were suspected and tested most often. A positive PT reaction to one or more drug was seen in 89 of 826 (10.8%), most often to beta-lactams, clindamycin and trimethoprim. A positive SPT reaction was seen in 10 of 935 (1.1%) patients. Challenge was carried out in 17 patients with positive skin test results. Thirteen of 16 (81.2%) PT positives developed exanthema, three remained negative and one SPT-positive patient developed urticaria. Among skin test negatives, 207 of 229 (90.4%) challenges were negative and 22 of 229 (9.6%) were positive, 12 with exanthema, three with fixed drug eruptions and seven with urticaria. Conclusions Skin testing, especially the PT, was a useful screening method to find a cause of CADR if the reaction was exanthema and if antimicrobial, cardiovascular or antiepileptic drugs were suspected. The SPT detected occasional positives with antimicrobials. In cases of fixed drug eruption, PTs performed at the earlier reaction site were useful. When skin tests are negative or dubious, oral challenge should be carried out to confirm the association.

It has been suggested that the enhanced exposure to endotoxin is an important protective factor of farm environments. Little is known about exposure to other microbial components on farms and exposure in anthroposophic families. Objective: To assess the levels and determinants of bacterial endotoxin, mould beta(1,3)-glucans and fungal extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in house dust of farm children, Steiner school children and reference children. Methods: Mattress and living room dust was collected in the homes of 229 farm children, 122 Steiner children and 60 and 67 of their respective reference children in five European countries. Stable dust was collected as well. All samples were analysed in one central laboratory. Determinants were assessed by questionnaire. Results: Levels of endotoxin, EPS and glucans per gram of house dust in farm homes were 1.2- to 3.2-fold higher than levels in reference homes. For Steiner children, 1.1- to 1.6-fold higher levels were observed compared with their reference children. These differences were consistently found across countries, although mean levels varied considerably. Differences between groups and between countries were also significant after adjustment for home and family characteristics. Conclusion: Farm children are not only consistently exposed to higher levels of endotoxin, but also to higher levels of mould components. Steiner school children may also be exposed to higher levels of microbial agents, but differences with reference children are much less pronounced than for farm children. Further analyses are, however, required to assess the association between exposure to these various microbial agents and allergic and airway diseases in the PARSIFAL population.

These proteinases can activate the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2, which has been shown to be upregulated in the airways of patients with asthma. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate PAR-2 activation in the airways during allergen challenge and its effects on the 2 principle features of asthma, airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Methods: Proteinase-activated receptor 2 activating peptide SLIGRL-NH2 (PAR-2 activating peptide [ap]) or control peptide LSIGRL-NH2 (PAR-2 control peptide [cp]) was administered alone or in conjunction with ovalbumin intranasally to mice, and AHR and airway inflammation were evaluated. Results: PAR2ap did not induce AHR or airway inflammation in ovalbumin-sensitized mice that had not been challenged with ovalbumin. When administered with ovalbumin, PAR-2ap enhanced AHR and airway inflammation compared with ovalbumin administered alone or with PAR-2cp. The enhanced AHR persisted for 5 days, whereas the enhancement to airway inflammation dissipated. Mice administered PAR-2ap alone during the 5 days after the final antigen challenge demonstrated an additional enhancement to airway inflammation compared with the control animals. PAR-2ap administered with allergen increased TNF and IL-5 mRNA in lung tissue and IL-13 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusion: Exogenous PAR-2 activation in parallel with allergen challenge enhances allergen-mediated AHR and airway inflammation through distinct mechanisms. PAR-2 activation can also enhance established airway inflammation even when dissociated from exposure to allergen. Therefore, PAR-2 activation may play a pathogenic role in the development of AHR and airway inflammation.

We estimated the health benefits of attaining the ozone standard at these monitors using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program. We used health impact functions based on published epidemiologic studies, and valuation functions derived from the economics literature. The estimated health benefits for 2000 and 2001 are similar in magnitude, whereas the results for 2002 are roughly twice that of each of the prior 2 years. The simple average of health impacts across the 3 years includes reductions of 800 premature deaths, 4,500 hospital and emergency department admissions, 900,000 school absences, and > 1 million minor restricted activity days. The simple average of benefits (including premature mortality) across the 3 years is $5.7 billion [90% confidence interval (0), 0.6-15-01 for the quadratic rollback simulation method and $4.9 billion (90% CI, 0.5-14.0) for the proportional rollback simulation method. Results are sensitive to the form of the standard and to assumptions about background ozone levels. If the form of the standard is based on the first highest maximum 8-hr concentration, impacts are increased by a factor of 2-3. Increasing the assumed hourly background from zero to 40 ppb reduced impacts by 30 and 60% for the proportional and quadratic attainment simulation methods, respectively.

This study aims to assess the impact of a multidisciplinary paediatric allergy clinic consultation on parental knowledge of food allergy and to determine the rate of subsequent allergic reactions. Methods: Sixty-two subjects (< 17 years) referred with food allergy were prospectively enrolled. Parental knowledge was assessed by questionnaire and EpiPen trainer. Families saw a paediatric allergist, clinical nurse specialist and dietician. Knowledge was reassessed after 3 months and rate of allergic reactions after 1 year. Results: After one visit to the paediatric allergy clinic, there was a significant improvement in parental knowledge of allergen avoidance (26.9%, P < 0.001), managing allergic reactions (185.4%, P < 0.0001) and EpiPen usage (83.3%, P < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in allergic reactions (P < 0.001). Children with egg, milk or multiple food allergies were more likely to suffer subsequent reactions. Conclusions: A single visit to a multidisciplinary allergy clinic considerably improves families' abilities to manage allergic reactions to foods with an accompanying reduction in allergic reactions. Young children with egg, milk or multiple food allergies were at greatest risk of further reactions.

However, the C57BL/6 murine strain does not display the large increase in circulating IgG and IgE antibodies found in human atopy and asthma. We found that commercial ovalbumin was contaminated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in amounts sufficient to fully activate endothelial cells in an in vitro assay of the first step of inflammation. Desensitization of TLR4 by LPS pretreatment suppressed the inflammatory effect of ovalbumin. The presence of LPS was occult, because it does not require serum presentation and, like the LPS of Salmonella minnesota, was not suppressed by polymyxin B. Purified ovalbumin did not activate endothelial cells in vitro; however, endotoxin-free ovalbumin was far more effective than commercial material in stimulating IgE production and respiratory dysfunction in a C57BL/6 murine model of AHR. Moreover, endotoxin-free ovalbumin induced lung inflammation with alveolar enlargement and destruction in a histologic pattern that differed from the changes caused by commercial, endotoxin-contaminated ovalbumin. Reconstitution of purified ovalbumin with S. minnesota LPS decreased lung inflammation, decreased changes in lung function, and suppressed anti-ovalbumin antibody production. We conclude endotoxin contaminates ovalbumin preparations and that endotoxin co-administration with the ovalbumin antigen creates a state of tolerance in a murine model of AHR. Co-exposure to endotoxin and antigen occurs in humans through organic dusts, so murine models of AHR may reflect the clinical situation, but models based on commercial ovalbumin do not accurately reflect the effect of protein antigen alone on animal physiology.

Plasmin degrades the extracellular matrix (ECM), either directly removing glycoproteins from ECM or by activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). PAI-1 blocking MMPs may prevent ECM degradation, but inhibiting fibrinolysis leads to fibrin accumulation and fibrosis. Components of the plasmin system including tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2 are synthesised by airway cells, and inflammatory mediators affect their expression. The plasmin system, in turn, actively influences the production of inflammatory mediators,and growth factors, extending pathological structural changes in the airway. Modulation of the plasmin system might be a new pharmacological strategy that could inhibit the development of airway remodeling. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This increase may result from increased recruitment, increased proliferation, or reduced cell death. Apoptosis regulates inflammatory cell survival, and p21(CIP1/WAF1) is an important inhibitory regulator of cycle progression after oxidative stress. We have investigated whether chronic smoke exposure influences the expression and localization of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in AM and bronchial epithelial cells in vivo. The increased numbers of AMs seen in smokers were only partially due to enhanced proliferation. p21(CIP1/WAF1) protein expression was increased in AMs and biopsies isolated from smokers and was found predominantly within the cytoplasm. In addition, B cell lymphoma leukemia (BCl)-x(L), an antiapoptotic regulator, was also highly expressed in macrophages from smokers compared with nonsmokers and subjects with asthma. Hydrogen peroxide, an oxidative stress, induced cytoplasmic expression of p21(CiP1/WAF1) and failed to induce apoptosis in an in vitro model. These results suggested that AM and bronchial epithelial cells from smokers, in contrast to those from normal subjects and subjects with asthma, have reduced cell death. Thus, oxidative stress induced by cigarette smoking may contribute to the chronicity of inflammation in the airway, through a reduction of apoptosis.

Although substantial evidence exists on molecular and physiologic impacts, the evidence needed to establish concentration-response functions is somewhat limited. Furthermore, because exposure to ozone depends on factors such as air conditioning use, past epidemiologic studies may not be directly applicable in unstudied settings. To evaluate the evidence likely to contribute significantly to benefits, we focus on four health outcomes: premature mortality, chronic asthma, respiratory hospital admissions, and minor restricted activity days. We determine concentration-response functions for these health outcomes for a hypothetical case study in Houston, Texas, using probabilistic weighting reflecting our judgment of the strength of the evidence and the possibility of confounding. We make a similar presentation for valuation, where uncertainty is due primarily to the lack of willingness-to-pay data for the population affected by ozone. We estimate that the annual monetary value of health benefits from reducing ozone concentrations in Houston is approximately $10 per person per microgram per cubic meter (24-hr average) reduced (95% confidence: interval, $0.70-$40). The central estimate exceeds past estimates by approximately a factor of five, driven by the inclusion of mortality. We discuss the implications of our findings for future analyses and determine areas of research that might help reduce the uncertainties in benefit estimation.

RBM was significantly thicker in asthma (10.1 +/- 3.7 mum) and perennial rhinitis (11.2 +/- 4.2 mum) than in seasonal rhinitis (4.7 +/- 0.7 mum) and COPD (5.2 +/- 0.7 mum). The dose (geometric mean) of MCh causing a 20% decrease of 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was significantly higher in perennial rhinitis (1,073 mug) than in asthma (106 mug). In COPD, the slope of the linear regression of all values of forced vital capacity plotted against FEV1 during the challenge was higher, and the intercept less, than in other groups, suggesting enhanced airway closure. In asthma, RBM thickness was positively correlated (r = 0.77) with the dose (geometric mean) of MCh causing a 20% decrease of FEV1 and negatively correlated (r = -0.73) with the forced vital capacity vs. FEV1 slope. We conclude that 1) RBM thickening is not unique to bronchial asthma, and 2) when present, it may protect against airway narrowing and air trapping. These findings support the opinion that RBM thickening represents an additional load on airway smooth muscle.

Despite their induction by different mechanisms, they cannot be differentiated by macroscopic appearance and, by histological examination they are both generally characterized by a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate and capillary hyperpermeability. Recently, cytokines, a family of inducible glycoproteins that play a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory reactions, have been identified as useful tools for differentiation of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. In this article the role of cytokines in the development and differentiation of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A mechanism linking exposure to this endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide)-rich environment with protection has remained elusive. Here we show that chronic exposure to low-dose endotoxin or farm dust protects mice from developing house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma. Endotoxin reduced epithelial cell cytokines that activate dendritic cells (DCs), thus suppressing type 2 immunity to HDMs. Loss of the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 in lung epithelium abolished the protective effect. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding A20 was associated with allergy and asthma risk in children growing up on farms. Thus, the farming environment protects from allergy by modifying the communication between barrier epithelial cells and DCs through A20 induction.

There is a need to assess the scope and substance of published research on medical homes. This article reviews published evaluations of medical home care for the period 2007 to 2010. Chief findings from these evaluations as a whole include associations between the provision of medical home care and improved quality, in addition to decreased utilization associated with medical home care in high-cost areas such as emergency department use. However, fewer associations were found across evaluations between medical home care and enhanced patient or family experiences. The early medical home research appears to reflect both the wide variation in how medical homes are being designed and implemented in practice and in how researchers are choosing to evaluate patient-centered medical home design and implementation. While some aspects of medical home care show promise, continued evolution of medical home evaluative research is needed.

The authors present this discussion in the context of a Mendelian randomization analysis of the effect of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) on the risk of asthma at age 7 years (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, 19911992). The authors show that the multiplicative structural mean model (MSMM) and the multiplicative generalized method of moments (MGMM) estimator produce identical estimates of the causal risk ratio. In the example, MSMM and MGMM estimates suggested an inverse relation between BMI and asthma but other IV estimates suggested a positive relation, although all estimates had wide confidence intervals. An interaction between the associations of BMI and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype with asthma explained the different directions of the different estimates, and a simulation study supported the observation that MSMM/MGMM estimators are negatively correlated with the other estimators when such an interaction is present. The authors conclude that point estimates from various IV methods can differ in practical applications. Based on the theoretical properties of the estimators, structural mean models make weaker assumptions than other IV estimators and can therefore be expected to be consistent in a wider range of situations.

TRENDS IN GENETICS			English	Review							EARLY RESPIRATORY-INFECTIONS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; TOBACCO-SMOKE EXPOSURE; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; AIR-POLLUTION; LUNG-FUNCTION; HAY-FEVER; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS	Many environmental risk factors for common, complex human diseases have been revealed by epidemiologic studies, but how genotypes at specific loci modulate individual responses to environmental risk factors is largely unknown. Gene-environment interactions will be missed in genome-wide association studies and could account for some of the 'missing heritability' for these diseases. In this review, we focus on asthma as a model disease for studying gene-environment interactions because of relatively large numbers of candidate gene-environment interactions with asthma risk in the literature. Identifying these interactions using genome-wide approaches poses formidable methodological problems, and elucidating molecular mechanisms for these interactions has been challenging. We suggest that studying gene-environment interactions in animal models, although more tractable, might not be sufficient to shed light on the genetic architecture of human diseases. Lastly, we propose avenues for future studies to find gene environment interactions.

Although parental smoking is the commonest source of ETS exposure to children, they are also exposed to ETS in schools, restaurants, public places and public transport vehicles. Apart from containing thousands of chemicals, the particle size in the ETS is much smaller than the main stream smoke, and therefore has a greater penetrability in the airways of children. Exposure to ETS has been shown to be associated with increased prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections, wheeze, asthma and lower respiratory tract infections. Even developing fetuses are exposed to ETS via the umbilical cord blood if the mother is exposed to tobacco smoke. The placenta also does not offer any barrier to the penetration of ETS into the fetus. The immune system in these babies is more deviated toward the allergic and asthmatic inflammatory phenotype and therefore makes them more prone to develop asthma later in life. An increased awareness of the harmful effects of ETS on children's health is warranted.

Alveolar Macrophages Transport Pathogens to Lung Draining Lymph Nodes	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							PULMONARY DENDRITIC CELLS; PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA; IN-VIVO; B-CELLS; SUBCAPSULAR SINUS; SIGLEC-F; MOUSE; ANTIGEN; INFLAMMATION; INFECTION	The first step in inducing pulmonary adaptive immunity to allergens and airborne pathogens is Ag acquisition and transport to the lung draining lymph nodes (dLN). Dendritic cells (DC) sample the airways, and active transfer of Ag to the lung dLN is considered an exclusive property of migratory DC. However, alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first phagocytes to contact inhaled particulate matter. Although having well-defined immunoregulatory capabilities, AM are generally considered as restricted to the alveoli. We show that murine AM constitutively migrate from lung to dLN and that following exposure to Streptococcus pneumoniae, AM rapidly transport bacteria to this site. Thus AM, and not DC, appear responsible for the earliest delivery of these bacteria to secondary lymphoid tissue. The identification of this novel transport pathway has important consequences for our understanding of lung immunity and suggests more widespread roles for macrophages in the transport of Ags to lymphoid organs than previously appreciated.

Symptoms and Medication Use in Children with Asthma and Traffic-Related Sources of Fine Particle Pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						childhood asthma; fine particle pollution; PM(2.5); respiratory morbidity; source apportionment; traffic pollution	AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR-POLLUTION; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; SOURCE-APPORTIONMENT; LUNG-FUNCTION; EMISSION FACTORS; 1ST YEAR; ASSOCIATION; PM2.5; MORTALITY	BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient fine particles [particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m diameter (PM(2.5))] is a potential factor in the exacerbation of asthma. National air quality particle standards consider total mass, not composition or sources, and may not protect against health impacts related to specific components. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between daily exposure to fine particle components and sources, and symptoms and medication use in children with asthma. METHODS: Children with asthma (n = 149) 4-12 years of age were enrolled in a year-long study. We analyzed particle samples for trace elements (X-ray fluorescence) and elemental carbon (light reflectance). Using factor analysis/source apportionment, we identified particle sources (e.g., motor vehicle emissions) and quantified daily contributions. Symptoms and medication use were recorded on study diaries. Repeated measures logistic regression models examined associations between health outcomes and particle exposures as elemental concentrations and source contributions. RESULTS: More than half of mean PM(2.5) was attributed to traffic-related sources motor vehicles (42%) and road dust (12%). Increased likelihood of symptoms and inhaler use was largest for 3-day averaged exposures to traffic-related sources or their elemental constituents and ranged from a 10% increased likelihood of wheeze for each 5-mu g/m(3) increase in particles from motor vehicles to a 28% increased likelihood of shortness of breath for increases in road dust. Neither the other sources identified nor PM(2.5) alone was associated with increased health outcome risks. CONCLUSIONS: Linking respiratory health effects to specific particle pollution composition or sources is critical to efforts to protect public health. We associated increased risk of symptoms and inhaler use in children with asthma with exposure to traffic-related fine particles.

Use of CpG oligonucleotides in treatment of asthma and allergic disease	ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS			English	Review						Asthma; Atopy; Inflammation; CpG oligonucleotides; Immunotherapy	DENDRITIC CELLS; MURINE MODEL; IMMUNOSTIMULATORY DNA; INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; CUTTING EDGE; OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES; MOTIFS; EXPRESSION; ANTIGEN	In the last several decades, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of atopic disorders including asthma in "Western" societies; a relationship has been identified between lack of early-life exposure to microbes or microbial products and increased susceptibility to atopic disorders. The innate immune system is activated by early microbial exposures, many of which utilize one of the Toll-like receptors, and there has been significant interest in studying how ligation of TLRs may be therapeutically useful. CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN, resembling bacterial DNA) engage TLR-9 on B-cells, dendritic cells and other cell types, resulting in a cascade that includes induction of Th1-type and T-regulatory-type immune responses. Preclinical models of asthma have demonstrated that CpG-ODN are potent inhibitors of atopic responses, suppressing Th2 cytokine and, reducing airway eosinophilia, systemic levels of IgE, and bronchial hyperreactivity-in short the critical attributes of the asthmatic phenotype. In models of chronic allergen exposure, CpG-ODN are also effective at preventing the development of airway remodeling. In established asthma, CpG-ODN can reverse manifestations of disease both when used alone or in combination with allergen immunotherapy. Early clinical trials have had mixed results, including a significant benefit when CpG-ODN were conjugated to ragweed allergen in an allergic rhinitis immunotherapy study, but only limited efficacy seen when administered prior to allergen challenge in asthmatics. Further study of CpG-ODNs for the treatment of asthma and other atopic disorders is warranted by existing data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For a more comprehensive review of allergy diagnostic testing, readers can refer to the Allergy Diagnostic Practice Parameters. A key message is that a positive allergy test result (skin or blood) indicates only the presence of allergen specific IgE (called sensitization). It does not necessarily mean clinical allergy (ie, allergic symptoms with exposure). It is important for this reason that the allergy evaluation be based on the patient's history and directed by a health care professional with sufficient understanding of allergy diagnostic testing to use the information obtained from his/her evaluation of the patient to determine (1) what allergy diagnostic tests to order, (2) how to interpret the allergy diagnostic test results, and (3) how to use the information obtained from the allergy evaluation to develop an appropriate therapeutic treatment plan.

In industrialized countries, egg allergy accounts for one of the most prevalent food hypersensitivities, especially in children. Atopic dermatitis represents the most common clinical manifestation in infancy; however, the range of clinical signs is broad and encompasses life-threatening anaphylaxis. The dominant egg allergens are proteins and are mainly present in the egg white, for example, ovalbumin, ovomucoid, ovotransferrin, and lysozyme. However, egg yolk also displays low-level allergenicity, for example, (x-livetin. Strict avoidance of the offending food remains the most common recommendation for egg-allergic individuals. Nevertheless, the omnipresence of egg-derived components in prepackaged or prepared foods makes it difficult. Therefore, more efficient preventive approaches are investigated to protect consumers from inadvertent exposure and ensuing adverse reactions. On the one hand, commercial kits have become readily available that allow for the detection of egg contaminants at trace levels. On the other hand, attempts to produce hypoallergenic egg-containing products through food-processing techniques have met with promising results, but the approach is limited due to its potentially undesirable effects on the unique functional and sensory attributes of egg proteins. Therefore, the development of preventive or curative strategies for egg allergy remains strongly warranted. Pilot studies have suggested that oral immunotherapy (IT) with raw or cooked preparations of egg may represent a safe alternative, immediately available to allergic subjects, but remains applicable to only nonanaphylactic patients. Due to the limitations of conventional IT, novel forms of immunotherapy are sought based on information obtained from the-molecular characterization of major egg allergens. In the past decade, promising approaches to the treatment and prevention of egg allergy have been explored and include, among others, the production of hypoallergenic recombinant egg proteins, the development of customized peptides, and bacterial-mediated immunotherapy. Nonspecific approaches have also been evaluated, and preliminary trials with the use of probiotic bacteria have yielded encouraging results. The current understanding of egg allergens offers novel approaches toward the making of food products safe for human consumption and the development of efficient immunotherapeutic strategies.

Inflammation-induced uptake and degradation of the lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; L-SELECTIN LIGAND; MAJOR E-SELECTIN; ENDOCYTOSIS HARE; DENDRITIC CELLS; BINDING PROTEINS; GENE-EXPRESSION; TNF-ALPHA; CD44; LYMPHANGIOGENESIS	The hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 is selectively expressed in the endothelium of lymphatic capillaries, where it has been proposed to function in hyaluronan clearance and hyaluronan-mediated leukocyte adhesion. However, recent studies suggest that hyaluronan homeostasis is unperturbed in LYVE-1(-/-) mice and that lymphatic adhesion/transmigration may be largely mediated by ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 rather than LYVE-1. Here we have explored the possibility that LYVE-1 functions during inflammation and report that the receptor is down-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using cultured primary lymphatic endothelial cells, we show that surface expression of LYVE-1 is rapidly and reversibly lost after exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha( TNF alpha) and TNF beta via internalization and degradation of the receptor in lysosomes, coupled with a shutdown in gene expression. Curiously, internalization does not result in significant uptake of hyaluronan, a process that is largely insensitive to the novel LYVE-1 adhesion blocking monoclonal antibody 3A, and proceeds almost equally in resting and inflammation-activated lymphatic endothelial cells. Finally, we show that TNF can induce down-modulation of LYVE-1 in ex vivo murine dermal tissue explants and present evidence that the process occurs in vivo, in the context of murine allergen-induced skin inflammation. These findings suggest that LYVE-1 can function independently of hyaluronan and have implications for the use of LYVE-1 as a histological marker for lymphangiogenesis in human pathology.

Effects of air pollution on asthma hospitalization rates in different age groups in Hong Kong	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						age; air pollution; asthma; exacerbation; Hong Kong	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; AMBIENT AIR; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; HEART-FAILURE; ADMISSIONS; CHILDREN; MORTALITY; CITIES; ASSOCIATIONS	Aims To assess the relationship between levels of ambient air pollutants and hospitalization rates for asthma in Hong Kong (HK). Methods This is a retrospective ecological study. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in HK for asthma and indices of air pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of < 10 mu m particulate matter (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5)] and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2005 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed by the generalized additive models with Poisson distribution. The effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity were adjusted. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. Results Altogether, 69 716 admissions were assessed. Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for asthma and levels of NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5. The relative risks (RR) for hospitalization for every 10 mu g/m(3) increase in NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5 were 1.028, 1.034, 1.019 and 1.021, respectively, at a lag day that ranged from cumulative lag 0-4 to 0-5. In a multi-pollutant model, O-3 was significantly associated with increased admissions for asthma. The younger age group (0-14 years) tended to have a higher RR for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in pollutants than those aged 15-65 years. The elderly (aged >= 65 years) had a shorter 'best' lag time to develop asthma exacerbation following exposure to pollutants than those aged < 65 years. Conclusion Adverse effects of ambient concentrations of air pollutants on hospitalization rates for asthma are evident. Measures to improve air quality in HK are urgently needed.

Most efficacy studies in children lack power to be conclusive, and all have been performed in referral centers. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of SLIT with grass pollen allergen in children and adolescents with rhinoconjunctivitis in a primary care setting. Methods: Youngsters aged 6-18 years with hay fever were enrolled from general practices and randomly assigned to receive placebo or grass pollen mix for 2 years. The primary outcome was the mean daily total symptom score (scale 0-15) comprising sneezing, itching nose, watery running nose, nasal blockage, and itching eyes during the months May-August of the second treatment year. Results: Out of 204 youngsters randomized, 168 entered the intention-to-treat analysis (91 verum, 77 placebo). The mean daily total symptom score did not differ between participants allocated to verum and those allocated to placebo (difference for verum minus placebo: -0.08, 95% CI, -0.66-0.50; P =.78). No differences were found for rescue medication-free days, disease-specific quality of life, and overall evaluation of the treatment effect. Local side effects were more frequent in the verum group (39% vs 17% of participants; P =.001). Conclusion: Sublingual immunotherapy with grass pollen in a primary care setting is not effective in children and adolescents. Clinical implications: Currently, SLIT cannot be recommended for general practitioners as a therapeutic modality in youngsters with grass pollen allergy.

Anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties of the essential oil and active compounds from Cordia verbenacea	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						essential oil; Cordia verbenacea; inflammation; allergy; TNF alpha; active compounds	CARRAGEENAN-INDUCED INFLAMMATION; CRUDE LEAF EXTRACT; PHARMACOLOGICAL ASSAY; UP-REGULATION; PLANT-ORIGIN; NITRIC-OXIDE; RAT; EDEMA; MODULATION; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2	The anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects of the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea (Boraginaceae) and some of its active compounds were evaluated. Systemic treatment with the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea (300-600 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema, myeloperoxidase activity and the mouse oedema elicited by carrageenan, bradykinin, substance P, histamine and platelet-activating factor. It also prevented carrageenan-evoked exudation and the neutrophil influx to the rat pleura and the neutrophil migration into carrageenan-stimulated mouse air pouches. Moreover, Cordia verbenacea oil inhibited the oedema caused by Apis mellifera venom or ovalbumin in sensitized rats and ovalbumin-evoked allergic pleurisy. The essential oil significantly decreased TNF alpha, without affecting IL-1 beta production, in carrageenan-injected rat paws. Neither the PGE(2) formation after intrapleural injection of carrageenan nor the COX-1 or COX-2 activities in vitro were affected by the essential oil. Of high interest, the paw edema induced by carrageenan in mice was markedly inhibited by both sesquiterpenic compounds obtained from the essential oil: alpha-humulene and trans-caryophyllene (50 mg/kg, p.o.). Collectively, the present results showed marked anti-inflammatory effects for the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea and some active compounds, probably by interfering with TNFa production. Cordia verbenacea essential oil or its constituents might represent new therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of house dust mite (HDM) SLIT in addition to allergen avoidance and standard pharmacologic treatment. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 111 children (aged 5-15 yr) with HDM-induced mild-to-moderate asthma. After a 4-week baseline phase, patients were randomly assigned to receive SLIT with tablets of HDM extract (n = 55) or placebo (n = 56) for 18 months. Pharmacologic treatment was adjusted every 3 months following a step-down approach. Asthma symptom scores, reduction in use of inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta(2)-agonists, rhinitis symptoms, lung function tests, skin sensitivity to HDM, dust mite-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG(4), and quality of life (QoL) were assessed during the study. After 18 months of treatment, diurnal and nocturnal asthma symptoms scores did not show significant differences between SLIT and placebo groups. Inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta(2)-agonists use was reduced in both groups without significant differences between groups. There were no significant differences in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak flow rate variations) between groups. Rhinitis symptom score decreased in both groups, with no difference between the two groups. The severity dimension of QoL was significantly improved in the SLIT group (age 6-12 yr). SLIT induced a significant reduction of skin sensitivity to HDM (p < 0.01) and a significant increase in HDM-specific IgE and IgG(4) antibodies (p < 0.001) in the SLIT group compared with the placebo group. SLIT was well tolerated with mild/moderate local adverse events. No severe systemic reactions were reported. This study indicates that, when mild-moderate asthmatic children are optimally controlled by pharmacologic treatment and HDM avoidance, SLIT does not provide additional benefit, despite a significant reduction in allergic response to HDM. Under such conditions, only a complete, but ethically unfeasible, discontinuation of inhaled corticosteroid would have demonstrated a possible benefit of SLIT.

In healthy individuals, the B-cell response varies between there being no response and the production of IgG(4)- or IgG(1)-dominating allergen-specific antibodies in the presence or absence of low amounts of IgE. If a detectable immune response is mounted, T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells specific for common environmental allergens consistently represent the dominant subset in healthy individuals. Exposure to high doses of allergens leads to a high concentration of specific IgG(4), detectable IgE and a TO type of immune response. Induction of IL-10- and TGF-beta-producing TO cells, IgG(4) isotype blocking antibodies, and suppressed mast cells, basophils and eosinophils represent major components of a relatively normalized immune response after allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT).

Health effects of the 2003 Southern California wildfires on children	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						air pollution; asthma; sore throat; wheezing	AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; PARTICULATE MATTER; FOREST-FIRES; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; VISITS; ASTHMA; SMOKE	Rationale: In late October 2003, Southern California wildfires burned more than 3,000 km(2). The wildfires produced heavy smoke that affected several communities participating in the University of Southern California Children's Health Study (CHS). Objectives: To study the acute effects of fire smoke on the health of CHS participants. Methods: A questionnaire was used to assess smoke exposure and occurrence of symptoms among CHS high-school students (n = 873; age, 17-18 yr) and elementary-school children (n = 5,551; age, 6-7 yr), in a total of 16 communities. Estimates of particulate matter (PM10) concentrations during the 5 d with the highest fire activity were used to characterize community smoke level. Main Results: All symptoms (nose, eyes, and throat irritations; cough; bronchitis; cold; wheezing; asthma attacks), medication usage, and physician visits were associated with individually reported exposure differences within communities. Risks increased monotonically with the number of reported smoky days. For most outcomes, reporting rates between communities were also associated with the fire-related PM10 levels. Associations tended to be strongest among those without asthma. Individuals with asthma were more likely to take preventive action, such as wearing masks or staying indoors during the fire. Conclusions: Exposure to wildfire smoke was associated with increased eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use, and physician visits.

QLK4-2001-00250), under the Fifth Framework Program in the field of epidemiology of allergic diseases. The aim of this paper was to describe the background and design as well as the aims of the project. Asthma and allergic disorders are a major public health problem in many Western countries. The aetiology of asthma and allergic disease remains poorly understood despite considerable research. Epidemiology has the potential to add greatly to the understanding by elucidating the risk factors for asthma and allergic disease and thereby suggesting productive avenues for research into causation and prevention. Several risk factors for the development of asthma and atopic disease in children such as passive smoke exposure during pregnancy and infancy, low birth weight or high body mass index later in life have been described. Furthermore, there is consistent evidence that the prevalence of atopy increases with higher socio-economic status. Levels of air pollution such as ozone, NO2, SO2 and particles are likely to provoke acute exacerbations of pre-existent respiratory disease. Their role in the inception of asthma and allergies remains to be clarified. Allergen exposure has been linked to the development of atopic sensitization to that particular allergen in children as well as in adults with occupational exposures. Exposure to house dust mite or cat allergen is, however, unlikely to contribute to the development of childhood asthma. In turn, pet keeping in the first year of life, particularly, dog keeping, has been inversely related to the development of wheeze and atopic illnesses. Several prospective birth cohort studies found a decreased prevalence of atopic disease in children having daily contact to pets, in particular to cats and dogs, during early infancy (1, 2). The protective effect might be attributable to allergen or other exposures associated with pet ownership, but may also in part be because of the removal of pets in families with sensitized or symptomatic children or in families with a positive history for atopy at the time the child was born.

However, the effect of early-life exposure, the fundamental window of exposure, is unknown. We assessed the association between prenatal DDE and other organochlorine compounds, and atopy and asthma during infancy. All women presenting for antenatal care in Menorca (Spain) over 12 months starting in mid-1997 were invited to take part in a longitudinal study; 482 children were subsequently enrolled, and 468 (97.1%) provided complete outcome data up to the fourth year of study. Prenatal exposure of organochlorine compounds was measured in cord serum in 405 (83%) children. Asthma was defined on the basis of wheezing at 4 years of age, persistent wheezing, or doctor-diagnosed asthma. We measured specific immunoglobulin-E (IgE) against house dust mite, cat, and grass in sera extracted at 4 years of age. DDE (median=1.03 ng/mL) was detected in all children, as well as hexachlorobenzene (0.68 ng/mL) and polychlorobiphenyls (0.69 ng/mL). Wheezing at 4 years of age increased with DDE concentration, particularly at the highest quartile [9% in the lowest quartile (<0.57 ng/mL) vs. 19% in the highest quartile (1.90 ng/mL); relative risk=2.63 (95% confidence interval 1.19-4.69), adjusting for maternal asthma, breast-feeding, education, social class, or other organochlorines]. The association was not modified by IgE sensitization and occurred with the same strength among nonatopic subjects and among those with persistent wheezing or diagnosed asthma. DDE was not associated with atopy alone. Prenatal exposure to DDE residues may contribute to development of asthma.

Objective: Determine whether asymptomatic infants with CF have evidence for changes in airway structure when assessed by high-resolution computed tomography, and whether airway structure correlates with airway function in this age group. Methods: Thirteen infants with CF (8-33 mo) and 13 control infants (7-25 mo) were evaluated. Airway wall and lumen areas were measured from three 1-mm-thick cross-sectional images obtained from upper, middle, and lower lobes during a respiratory pause with the lungs inflated to an airway pressure of 20 cm H2O. Lung tissue density was measured from images obtained during a respiratory pause at FRC. Forced expiratory flows were measured by the rapid thoracic compression technique in 11 infants with CF. Results: Airway wall area increased more per unit increase in airway size, whereas airway lumen area increased less per unit increase in airway size in the CF than in the control group. Among infants with CF, a greater ratio of wall to lumen area correlated with lower airway function. In addition, lung density at relaxed (passive) FRC was lower for infants with Cl: than for control infants (0.38 vs. 0.43 g/ml; p < 0.02). Conclusions: Our results indicate that infants with CF have thickened airway walls, narrowed airway lumens, and air trapping, when assessed by high-resolution computed tomography, and measurements of airway structure correlated with airway function.

Chronic exposure has been associated with decreased lung function in children and adolescents. This study investigated the effects of long-term exposure to O-3 on lung function in college freshmen. Methods: We recruited University of California, Berkeley students (n = 255) who were lifelong residents of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas and who never smoked. Lifetime exposures to O-3, small particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were based on spatial interpolation of compliance monitor measurements to all residences at which students lived. Spirometry was performed between February and May, times when students would not have had recent exposure to increased levels of O-3. Results: Lifetime exposure to O-3 was associated with decreased levels of measures of small airways ( < 2 mm) function (FEF75 and FEF25-75). There was an interaction with the FEF25-75/FVC ratio, a measure of intrinsic airway size. Subjects with a large ratio were less likely to have decreases in FEF75 and FEF25-75 for a given estimated lifetime exposure to O-3. This association was not altered by history of chronic respiratory disease, allergy, second-hand exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, exposure to PM10 and NO2, or measurement errors in exposure assessment. Conclusions: A history of increased level of lifetime exposure to ambient O-3 is associated with decreased function of airways in which O-3 deposition in the lungs is the greatest. Adolescents with intrinsically smaller airways appear to be at greatest risk. Any environmental or genetic factors that lead to reduced airway size may lead to increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of ambient ozone.

Americans are increasingly sedentary; erstwhile the rate of increase in obesity is alarming. New research suggests that increased auto dependence, and limited opportunities to walk for utilitarian purposes, has contributed to this emerging obesity, epidemic. Within socio-demographic strata, land use patterns and transportation investments collectively shape the desire to walk, drive, or to travel via other means. Mixed use and more compact community designs show significant promise for the promotion of physical activity and the reduction of regional air pollution levels. Opportunities exist to increase physical activity and improve regional air quality through more compact development. However, increased compactness, or density, often exacerbates traffic congestion and can increase exposure of harmful emissions within central areas. Therefore, strategies to reduce localized air pollution in existing and developing centers are required to enable larger health benefits from smart growth to be realized.

Objectives: We sought to evaluate the dose-response relationship between endotoxin and atopic sensitization in adult farmers and to assess the effect on respiratory health outcomes. Methods: Data on endotoxin exposure and serum IgE levels were available for 162 pig farmers from a cross-sectional, case-control study, with case selection on the basis of respiratory symptoms. Exposure to endotoxin was modeled in detail, and respiratory health effects were assessed during a medical examination. Exploratory analysis was done by using nonparametric modeling and was followed by classical parametric regression. Results: IgE to one or more common allergens was detected in sera from 28 (17%) farmers. The average (geometric mean) total serum IgE levels was 37 lU/mL (geometric SD, 4 IU/mL). A strong inverse relationship was found between endotoxin and sensitization to common allergens for exposures of 75 ng/m(3) or less, with an odds ratio of 0.03 (95% CI, 0.0-0.34) for a 2-fold increase in endotoxin. For endotoxin exposure of greater than 75 ng/m(3), the association was weak (odds ratio, 1.2 [95% Cl, 0.38-3.6]). No association was found between endotoxin exposure and total serum IgE levels. Endotoxin was associated with increased airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine and lower lung function in sensitized farmers, without evidence of a nonlinear relationship. Conclusions: The prevalence of atopic sensitization in adult pig farmers is low. Endotoxin or related exposures might protect from sensitization, even in an adult working population exposed to high levels of endotoxin, but is a risk factor for increased airway hyperresponsiveness and low lung function.

She explores a broad sample of health problems common to U.S. children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and lead poisoning, as well as maternal health problems and health-related behaviors that affect children's behavioral and cognitive readiness for school. If a health problem is to affect the readiness gap, it must affect many children, it must be linked to academic performance or behavior problems, and it must show a racial disparity either in its prevalence or in its effects. The author focuses not only on the black-white gap in health status but also on the poor-nonpoor gap because black children tend to be poorer than white children. The health conditions Currie considers seriously impair cognitive skills and behavior in individual children. But most explain little of the overall racial gap in school readiness. Still, the cumulative effect of health differentials summed over all conditions is significant. Curries rough calculation is that racial differences in health conditions and in maternal health and behaviors together may account for as much as a quarter of the racial gap in school readiness. Currie scrutinizes several policy steps to lessen racial and socioeconomic disparities in children's health and to begin to close the readiness gap. Increasing poor children's eligibility for Medicaid and state child health insurance is unlikely to be effective because most poor children are already eligible for public insurance. The problem is that many are not enrolled. Even increasing enrollment may not work: socioeconomic disparities in health persist in Canada and the United Kingdom despite universal public health insurance. The author finds more promise in strengthening early childhood programs with a built-in health component, like Head Start; family-based services and home visiting programs; and WIC, the federal nutrition program for women. infants, and small children.

Chemoattractant receptors have always been viewed as facilitators of cell movement into a tissue. This whole concept must now be revised with the discovery of sphingosine 1 phosphate receptors, which control cell exit from lymphoid tissues. The chemoattractants that regulate lymphoid tissue homing are usually different to those that regulate leukocyte recruitment to inflamed tissues. There is evidence, however, of inflammatory pathways of leukocyte recruitment in lymph nodes and, conversely of constitutive pathways in peripheral tissues. Finally, antagonists (or agonists) of chemoattractant receptors and their signalling pathways represent the most attractive strategy for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases, including allergy.

Objective: We sought to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention program in primary prevention of asthma in high-risk infants. Methods: We identified 545 high-risk infants on the basis of an immediate family history of asthma. Families were randomized into intervention or control groups. Intervention measures included avoidance of house dust mite, pet allergen, and environmental tobacco smoke. Breast-feeding was encouraged with formula supplementation if necessary, and introduction of solid foods was delayed. Results: At 2 years of age, 19.5% of the children had asthma, and 14.7% had atopy (positive skin test response to one or more common allergens). Significantly fewer children had asthma in the intervention group compared with in the control group (16.3% vs 23.0%), with 60% less persistent asthma at 2 years. There was a 90% reduction for recurrent wheeze in the intervention group compared with that seen in the control group. Exposure to maternal environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy or the first year was a risk factor for asthma at 2 years of age. A positive skin test response, particularly to food, at 12 months predicted asthma at 2 years. There was no significant difference for atopy between the intervention and control groups, but daycare reduced atopy at 2 years. Conclusion: This multifaceted intervention program during a window of opportunity in the first year of life was effective in preventing asthma in high-risk children at 2 years of age.

The prevalence of repeated otitis media ( OM) increased during the 1980s, but it is unknown if the increase has continued. Objectives. To determine trends in the prevalence of OM, early-onset OM, and repeated OM among US children from 1988 to 1994 and to identify factors that may explain any observed changes. Methods. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was administered in 2 phases: phase I ( 1988 - 1991) and phase II ( 1991 - 1994), each comprising a national probability sample. OM ( ever having had OM), early-onset OM ( first episode at < 12 months of age), and repeated OM (&GE; 3 episodes) were assessed for 8261 children < 6 years of age. Results. After controlling for risk factors for OM, the prevalence of OM from phase I to phase II increased from 66.7% to 69.7% ( odds ratio [ OR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [ CI] = .99, 1.1), early-onset OM increased from 41.1% to 45.8% ( OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.2), and repeated OM increased from 34.8% to 41.1% ( OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.4). This observed increase corresponds to 561 000 and 720 000 more children having early-onset OM and repeated OM, respectively. Child care use, early breastfeeding termination, asthma, and access to health care did not significantly increase from phase I to phase II. The prevalence of early-onset OM and repeated OM was higher for affluent children, but the greatest increase in prevalence was among impoverished children. There was an increase in allergic conditions from phase I to phase II for poor children (22.6% to 30.2%). Conclusions. The prevalence of early-onset OM and repeated OM continued to increase among preschool children in the United States. Further research to investigate this increasing prevalence should explore changes in management practice and an increase in prevalence of allergic conditions among poor children.

The effects of the Buteyko breathing technique, a device which mimics pranayama (a yoga breathing technique), and a dummy pranayama device on bronchial responsiveness and symptoms were compared over 6 months in a parallel group study. Methods: Ninety patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid were randomised after a 2 week run in period to Eucapnic Buteyko breathing, use of a Pink City Lung Exerciser (PCLE) to mimic pranayama, or a PCLE placebo device. Subjects practised the techniques at home twice daily for 6 months followed by an optional steroid reduction phase. Primary outcome measures were symptom scores and change in the dose of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) during the first 6 months. Results: Sixty nine patients (78%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in PD20 between the three groups at 3 or 6 months. Symptoms remained relatively stable in the PCLE and placebo groups but were reduced in the Buteyko group. Median change in symptom scores at 6 months was 0 (interquartile range -1 to 1) in the placebo group, -1 (-2 to 0.75) in the PCLE group, and -3 (-4 to 0) in the Buteyko group (p=0.003 for difference between groups). Bronchodilator use was reduced in the Buteyko group by two puffs/day at 6 months; there was no change in the other two groups (p=0.005). No difference was seen between the groups in FEV1, exacerbations, or ability to reduce inhaled corticosteroids. Conclusion: The Buteyko breathing technique can improve symptoms and reduce bronchodilator use but does not appear to change bronchial responsiveness or lung function in patients with asthma. No benefit was shown for the Pink City Lung Exerciser.

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM; EXPOSURE; CLEANERS	To describe the characteristics of individuals with work-related asthma associated with exposure to cleaning products, data from the California-, Massachusetts-, Michigan-, and New Jersey state-based surveillance systems of work-related asthma were used to identify cases of asthma associated with exposure to cleaning products at work. From 1993 to 1997, 236 (12 %) of the 1915 confirmed cases of work-related asthma identfied by the four states were associated with exposure to cleaning products. Eighty Percent of the reports were of new-onset asthma and 20% were work-aggravated asthma. Among the new-onset cases, 22 % were consistent with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Individuals identfied were generally women (75 %), white non-Hispanic (68 %), and 45 years or older (64 %). Their most likely exposure had been in medical settings (39 %), schools (13 %), or hotels (6 %), and they were most likely to work as janitor/cleaners (22 %), nurse/nurses' aides (20 %), or clerical staff (13 %). However, cases were reported with exposure to cleaning products across a wide range of job titles. Cleaning products contain a diverse group of chemicals that are used in a wide range of industries and occupations as well as in the home. Their potential to cause or aggravate asthma has recently been recognized. Further work to characterize the specific agents and the circumstances of their use associated with asthma is needed. Additional research to investigate the frequency of adverse respiratory effects among regular users, such as housekeeping staff, is also needed. In the interim, we recommend attention to adequate ventilation, improved warning labels and Material Safety Data Sheets, and workplace training and education.

The purpose of this study was to measure these chemokines, in tear and mucus samples of active-disease patients and in vitro cultured conjunctival epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Design: Comparative, observational case series and in vitro study. Participants: Sixteen patients with clinically active and untreated VKC or AKC, six age-matched control patients, and five nonactive seasonal allergic conjunctivitis patients. Methods: Tears were collected from the active VKC and AKC patients, and from the normal patients. Mucus was collected from six of these VKC patients. Tears were also collected from an additional five allergic patients after obtaining a positive reaction to conjunctival allergen challenge. Conjunctival epithelial cell and conjunctival fibroblast cultures were exposed to interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or to combinations of these cytokines. Main Outcome Measures: Levels of eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 in tears, mucus, and culture medium. Results: High levels of eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 were found in mucus of VKC patients, whereas only eotaxin-2 was found to have increased significantly in tears of VKC and AKC patients compared with those of normal patients. Mucus contained higher levels of chemokines than did tears. Both tear eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 were correlated significantly with the percent of eosinophils in tear fluid. Eotaxin-1 also was correlated significantly with the sum clinical score and corneal involvement in VKC patients. Conjunctival epithelial cells in culture did not produce eotaxin-1 or eotaxin-2, either at baseline or after cytokine exposure. Conjunctival fibroblasts produced eotaxin-1 only after exposure to IL-4, TNF-alpha, and the combination of IL-4 plus TNF-alpha or IL-13 plus TNF-alpha. Conclusions: Eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 are implicated in eosinophil recruitment and in the pathogenesis of VKC and AKC. Cytokine-stimulated conjunctival fibroblasts may be one source of eotaxin-1 in severely allergic tissues. (C) 2003 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Objective: We compared the effects of 5 mg of desloratadine and placebo on nasal airflow and SAR symptoms, including nasal congestion, in response to grass pollen in an allergen-exposure unit. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 47 subjects with histories of SAR received desloratadine or placebo every morning for 7 days and, after a 10-day washout period, were crossed over to the other treatment arm for 7 days. Subjects underwent a 6-hour allergen exposure on day 7 of each treatment period. Nasal airflow and nasal secretion weights were measured before and every 30 minutes during allergen exposure; SAR symptoms (including nasal congestion) were scored before exposure and every 15 minutes thereafter. Results: Nasal obstruction, as measured by nasal airflow, was less severe with desloratadine than with placebo (P < .02). Individual and combined SAR symptom severity scores, including nasal congestion and sneezing, were significantly lower with desloratadine than with placebo (all P less than or equal to .003). Within 30 minutes of allergen exposure, less severely decreased nasal airflow (P < .02), less nasal secretions (P < .001), and less severe symptoms, including nasal congestion (P < .002), rhinorrhea, and sneezing, occurred with desloratadine compared with placebo, and this continued throughout (0-6 hours) allergen exposure. Desloratadine was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. Conclusion: In subjects with allergen-induced SAR symptoms, desloratadine significantly reduced the severity of nasal obstruction and accompanying complaints of nasal congestion and other SAR symptoms compared with the effects of placebo.

Exigencies of inner-city living can increase psychosocial risk factors (e.g., stress) that confer increased asthma morbidity. In the United States, chronic exposure to violence is a unique stressor existing in many high-risk urban neighborhoods. In this paper, we describe a series of cases that exemplify a temporal association between exposure to violence and the precipitation of asthma exacerbations in four urban pediatric patients. In the first three cases, the nature of the exposure is characterized by the proximity to violence, which ranged from direct victimization (through either the threat of physical assault or actual assault) to learning of the death of a peer. The fourth case characterizes a scenario in which a child was exposed to severe parental conflict (i.e., domestic violence) in the hospital setting. Increasingly, studies have begun to explore the effect of living in a violent environment, with a chronic pervasive atmosphere of fear and the perceived or real threat of violence, on health outcomes in population-based studies. Violence exposure may contribute to environmental demands that tax both the individual and the communities in which they live to impact the inner-city asthma burden. At the individual level, intervention strategies aimed to reduce violence exposure, to reduce stress, or to counsel victims or witnesses to violence may be complementary to more traditional asthma treatment in these populations. Change in policies that address the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to crime and violence in urban America may have broader impact.

A novel major allergen, Ole e 9, has been isolated from olive pollen by gel permeation, hydrophobic affinity, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographies. It is involved in the allergic responses of 65% of patients suffering olive pollinosis. Ole e 9 (molecular mass of 46.4 kDa) displays 1,3-beta -endoglucanase activity (38.9 +/- 5.6 mg of glucose released/min x mu mol of protein at pH 4.5-6.0 using laminarin as substrate). It is the first 1,3-beta -glucanase, a member of the "pathogenesis-related" protein family, detected in pollen tissue. Seven tryptic peptides of the allergen were sequenced by Edman degradation and used for designing primers to clone the cDNA codifying the protein. Specific cDNA for Ole e 9 was synthesized from total RNA and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The allergen sequence showed an open reading frame of 460 amino acids comprising a putative signal peptide of 26 residues. It shows 39, 33, and 32% sequence identity including the catalytic residues when compared with 1,3-beta -glucanases from wheat, willow, and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that Ole e 9 transcript is specifically expressed in the pollen tissue, and highly conserved counterparts were only detected in taxonomically related pollens.

We examined whether polymorphisms in the GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes modify allergic responses to diisocyanate exposure. The study population consisted of 182 diisocyanate exposed workers, 109 diagnosed with diisocyanate-induce asthma and 73 without asthma, Lack of the GSTM1 gene (null genotype) was associated with a 1.89-fold risk of diisocyanate-induced asthma [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-3.52]. Moreover, among the asthma patients, the GSTM1 null genotype was associated with lack of diisocyanate-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies [odds ratio (OR) 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.61] and with late reaction in the specific bronchial provocation test (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.15-6.88). Similarly, GSTM3 AA genotype was related to late reaction in the specific bronchial provocation test (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.2), The GSTP1 Val/Val genotype, on the other hand, was related to high total IgE levels (OR 5.46, 95% CI 1.15-26.0). The most remarkable effect was seen for the combination of GSTM1 null anti. the GSTM3 AA genotype which was strongly associated with lack of diisocyanate-specific IgE antibodies (OR 0.09, 35% CI 0.01-0.73) and with late reaction in the bronchial provocation test (OR 11.0, 95% CI 2.19-55.3). The results suggest, for the first time, that the polymorphic GSTs, especially the mu class GSTs, play an important role in inception of ill effects related to occupational exposure to diisocyanates.

In this review methods for measuring exposure to fungi in the indoor environment are evaluated. A variety of markers for the presence of fungi are also described in addition to their known relationship to either toxic or adverse immunologic effects. Key studies documenting the clinical effects of different types of fungi are also reviewed, as well as a description of abatement methods that either have been successful or need further investigation. Although many studies have shown an association between exposure to fungi and allergic disease, in many cases a direct cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology and mechanisms behind fungal-induced human disease will hopefully establish this causal link and suggest methods for reducing morbidity.

Objective We investigated whether 10 weeks of high altitude allergen avoidance leads to sustained benefits regarding clinical and inflammatory markers of disease control in adolescents with persistent asthma despite treatment with high dose ICS. Methods Eighteen atopic asthmatic adolescents (12-18 yr, 500-2000 mug ICS daily) with established house dust mite allergy, participated in a parallel-group study. Quality of life (PAQL), lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to adenosine and histamine, induced sputum and urine samples were collected repeatedly from 10 patients during a 10-week admission period to the Swiss Alps (alt. 1560 m) and at 6 weeks after return to sea level. Results were compared with those in eight patients, studied in their home environment at sea level for a similar time period. Throughout the study, asthma medication remained unchanged in both groups. Results During admission to high altitude, PAQL, lung function, BHR to adenosine and histamine, and urinary levels of eosinophil protein X (U-EPX), leukotriene E-4 (U-LTE4) and 9 alpha 11 beta prostaglandin F-2 (U-9 alpha 11 beta PGF(2)) improved significantly (P < 0.05), with a similar tendency for sputum eosinophils (P < 0.07). Furthermore, the changes in PAQL and BHR to adenosine and histamine were greater in the altitude than in the control group (P < 0.05). At 6 weeks after renewed allergen exposure at sea level, the improvements in PAQL (P < 0.05), BHR to adenosine (P < 0.07) and histamine (P < 0.05), as well as U-EPX (P < 0.05) and U-LTE4 (P < 0.05) were maintained. Conclusion A short period of high altitude allergen avoidance, on top of regular treatment with ICS and long-acting beta (2)-agonists, results in improvement of asthma, as assessed by clinical and inflammatory markers of disease severity. These findings indicate that short-term, rigorous allergen avoidance can improve the long-term control of severe asthma over and above what can be achieved even by high doses of inhaled steroids.

Design: Cross-sectional survey at 2 managed care organizations in the United States (winter 1997-1998). The participants were parents of children (n = 318) age 5 to 17 years with asthma. There were no interventions. The outcome measures were indicators of care in 4 domains: (1) periodic physiologic assessment, (2) proper use of medications, (3) patient education, and (4) control of factors contributing to asthma severity. Results: Of 533 eligible patients with asthma, 318 (60%) parents responded; 59% of children were male, 76% were white, and 60% were aged 5 to 10 years. Deficiencies in care were identified in all care domains including, for patients with moderate and severe persistent symptoms, only 55% used long-term control medication daily, 49% had written instructions for handling asthma attacks, 44% had instructions for adjustment of medication before exposures, 56% had undergone allergy testing, and 54% had undergone pulmonary function testing. Conclusions: There are significant opportunities to improve the quality of care for children with asthma enrolled in managed care. A comprehensive approach to improving care may be necessary to address multiple aspects of care where opportunities exist.

To date, the relationship between allergy and rhinosinusitis has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the relative roles of perennial and seasonal allergens in the cause of chronic rhinosinusitis. A retrospective review of 200 consecutive patients was carried out on patients who had chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to medical therapy and who subsequently underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. All of these patients had allergy testing for common perennial and seasonal inhalant allergens before surgery. Each patient had sinus CT imaging before undergoing the surgery. The CT scans of each patient were staged according to a validated, standardized grading system by investigators blinded to allergic profile. Allergy testing indicated that 84% of all patients tested positive for allergies. Moreover, 60% of all patients had significant allergic sensitivity; 52% of all patients had multiple allergen sensitivities. Furthermore, there was a predominance of perennial allergens, especially house dust mite over seasonal allergens. The vast majority of our patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery had concomitant allergy. This study highlights the potential contribution of perennial allergies to the development of rhinosinusitis, Given this direction, future studies may reveal that in the care of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, early intervention with identification of the offending allergen(s), and subsequent treatment through avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and/or immunotherapy may help in the prevention of recurrent and chronic rhinosinusitis.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of newly produced eosinophils in airway allergic inflammation and to determine mechanisms of any enhanced eosinophilopoiesis, OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice were repeatedly exposed to allergen via airway route. Newly produced cells were identified using a thymidine analog, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, which is incorporated into DNA during mitosis. Identification of IL-5-producing cells in the bone marrow was performed using FAGS. Bone marrow CD3(+) cells were enriched to evaluate IL-5-protein release in vitro. Anti-ILS-treatment (TRFK-5) was given either systemically or directly to the airways. IL-SR-bearing cells were localized by immunocytochemistry. Repeated airway allergen exposure caused prominent airway eosinophilia after three to five exposures, and increased the number of immature eosinophils in the bone marrow. Up to 78% of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) granulocytes were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine positive. After three allergen exposures, both CD3+ and non-CD3 cells acquired from the bone marrow expressed and released IL-5-protein. Anti-IL-5 given i.p. inhibited both bone marrow and airway eosinophilia. Intranasal administration of anti-IL-5 also reduced BAL eosinophilia, partly via local effects in the airways. Bone marrow cells, but not BAL eosinophils, displayed stainable amounts of the IL-5R alpha-chain. We conclude that the bone marrow is activated by airway allergen exposure, and that newly produced eosinophils contribute to a substantial degree to the airway eosinophilia induced by allergen. Airway allergen exposure increases the number of cells expressing IL-5-protein in the bone marrow. The bone marrow, as well as the lung, are possible targets for anti-IL-5-treatment.

We investigated the effect of smoke-free legislation on perinatal and child health. Methods We searched 14 online databases from January, 1975 to May, 2013, with no language restrictions, for published studies, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished studies. Citations and reference lists of articles of interest were screened and an international expert panel was contacted to identify additional studies. We included studies undertaken with designs approved by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care that reported associations between smoking bans in workplaces, public places, or both, and one or more predefined early-life health indicator. The primary outcomes were preterm birth, low birthweight, and hospital attendances for asthma. Effect estimates were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013003522. Findings We identified 11 eligible studies (published 2008-13), involving more than 2.5 million births and 247 168 asthma exacerbations. All studies used interrupted time-series designs. Five North American studies described local bans and six European studies described national bans. Risk of bias was high for one study, moderate for six studies, and low for four studies. Smoke-free legislation was associated with reductions in preterm birth (four studies, 1 366 862 individuals; -10.4% [95% CI -18.8 to -2.0]; p=0.016) and hospital attendances for asthma (three studies, 225 753 events: -10.1% [95% CI -15.2 to -5.0]; p=0.0001). No significant effect on low birthweight was identified (six studies, >1.9 million individuals: -1.7% [95% CI -5.1 to 1.6]; p=0.31). Interpretation Smoke-free legislation is associated with substantial reductions in preterm births and hospital attendance for asthma. Together with the health benefits in adults, this study provides strong support for WHO recommendations to create smoke-free environments.

Early regular egg exposure in infants with eczema: A randomized controlled trial	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Allergy prevention; complementary feeding; eczema; egg; food allergy; oral tolerance; randomized controlled trial	ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY; ALLERGIC DISEASES; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; BIRTH COHORT; CHILDREN; FISH; SENSITIZATION; CHALLENGE; TOLERANCE; FORMULAS	Background: Observational studies suggest that early regular ingestion of allergenic foods might reduce the risk of food allergy. Objective: We sought to determine whether early regular oral egg exposure will reduce subsequent IgE-mediated egg allergy in infants with moderate-to-severe eczema. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial infants were allocated to 1 teaspoon of pasteurized raw whole egg powder (n = 49) or rice powder (n = 37) daily from 4 to 8 months of age. Cooked egg was introduced to both groups after an observed feed at 8 months. The primary outcome was IgE-mediated egg allergy at 12 months, as defined based on the results of an observed pasteurized raw egg challenge and skin prick tests. Results: A high proportion (31% [15/49]) of infants randomized to receive egg had an allergic reaction to the egg powder and did not continue powder ingestion. At 4 months of age, before any known egg ingestion, 36% (24/67) of infants already had eggspecific IgE levels of greater than 0.35 kilounits of antibody (kUA)/L. At 12 months, a lower (but not significant) proportion of infants in the egg group (33%) were given a diagnosis of IgE-mediated egg allergy compared with the control group (51%; relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38-1.11; P 5.11). Egg-specific IgG4 levels were significantly (P <.001) greater in the egg group at both 8 and 12 months. Conclusion: Induction of immune tolerance pathways and reduction in egg allergy incidence can be achieved by early regular oral egg exposure in infants with eczema. Caution needs to be taken when these high-risk infants are first exposed to egg because many have sensitization already by 4 months of age.

Based on this approach, tests on protein solutions are used to produce values for solubility, thermal stability, gelation, emulsifying, foaming, fat binding and water binding to name a few. While this approach is beneficial in understanding the properties of specific proteins and ingredients, it is somewhat restricted in predicting performance in real foods where the complexities of ingredients and processing operations have a significant affect on the colloidal structures and therefore overall properties of the final food product. In addition, focusing on proteins as just biopolymers used to create food structures ignores the biological functions of proteins in the diet. These can be beneficial, as in providing amino acids for protein synthesis or bioactive peptides, or these can be detrimental, as in causing a food allergic response. This review will focus on integrating the colloidal/polymer and biological aspects of protein functionality. This will be done using foams and gels to illustrate colloidal/polymer aspects and bioactive peptides and allergenicity to demonstrate biological function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The farming environment has consistently been associated with protection from childhood asthma and atopy, and interactions have been reported with polymorphisms in innate immunity genes. Objective: To detect gene-environment interactions for asthma and atopy in the farming environment. Methods: We performed a genome-wide interaction analysis for asthma and atopy by using 500,000 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and farm-related exposures in 1708 children from 4 rural regions of Central Europe. We also tested selectively for interactions between farm exposures and 7 SNPs that emerged as genome-wide significant in a large meta-analysis of childhood asthma and 5 SNPs that had been reported previously as interacting with farm exposures for asthma or atopy. Results: Neither the asthma-associated SNPs nor the SNPs previously published for interactions with asthma showed significant interactions. The genome-wide interaction study did not reveal any significant interactions with SNPs within genes in the range of interacting allele frequencies from 30% to 70%, for which our study was well powered. Among rarer SNPs, we identified 15 genes with strong interactions for asthma or atopy in relation to farming, contact with cows and straw, or consumption of raw farm milk. Conclusion: Common genetic polymorphisms are unlikely to moderate the protective influence of the farming environment on childhood asthma and atopy, but rarer variants, particularly of the glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1 gene, may do so. Given the limited statistical power of our study, these findings should be interpreted with caution before being replicated in independent farm populations. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:138-44.)

Anisakidosis: Perils of the Deep	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							MAJOR ALLERGEN; GASTRIC ANISAKIASIS; PARASITIC ZOONOSES; BOWEL OBSTRUCTION; EATING SUSHI; SIMPLEX; FISH; DIAGNOSIS; NEMATODA; IDENTIFICATION	Anisakidosis, human infection with nematodes of the family Anisakidae, is caused most commonly by Anisakis simplex and Pseudoterranova decipiens. Acquired by the consumption of raw or undercooked marine fish or squid, anisakidosis occurs where such dietary customs are practiced, including Japan, coastal regions of Europe, and the United States. Severe epigastric pain, resulting from larval invasion of the gastric mucosa, characterizes gastric anisakidosis; other syndromes are intestinal and ectopic. Allergic anisakidosis is a frequent cause of foodborne allergies in areas with heavy fish consumption or occupational exposure. Diagnosis and treatment of gastric disease is usually made by a compatible dietary history and visualization and removal of the larva(e) on endoscopy; serologic testing for anti-A. simplex immunoglobulin E can aid in the diagnosis of intestinal, ectopic and allergic disease. Intestinal and/or ectopic cases may require surgical removal; albendazole has been used occasionally. Preventive measures include adequately freezing or cooking fish.

Immunotherapy is effective in patients with mild forms of allergic disease and also in those who do not respond well to standard drug therapy. Most SIT is given by means of injection, but there is increasing interest in performing SIT through the sublingual route. SIT remains the treatment of choice for patients with systemic allergic reactions to wasp and bee stings and should be considered as an option in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or both. SIT can modify the course of allergic disease by reducing the risk of new allergic sensitizations and inhibiting the development of clinical asthma in children treated for allergic rhinitis. The precise mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of SIT remain a matter of research and debate. An effect on regulatory T cells seems most probable and is associated with switching of allergen-specific B cells toward IgG4 production. Few direct comparisons of SIT and drug therapy have been made. Existing data suggest that the effects of SIT take longer to develop, but once established, SIT achieves long-lasting relief of allergic symptoms, whereas the benefits of drugs only last as long as they are continued.

Functionally important role for arginase 1 in the airway hyperresponsiveness of asthma. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 296: L911-L920, 2009. First published March 13, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajplung.00025.2009.-L-Arginine metabolism by the arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) families of enzymes is important in NO production, and imbalances between these pathways contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. To investigate the role of arginase isozymes (ARG1 and ARG2) in AHR, we determined the protein expression of ARG1, ARG2, the NOS isozymes, and other proteins involved in L-arginine metabolism in lung tissues from asthma patients and in acute (3-wk) and chronic (12-wk) murine models of ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation. Expression of ARG1 was increased in human asthma, whereas ARG2, NOS isoforms, and the other L-arginine-related proteins (i.e., cationic amino acid transporters 1 and 2, agmatinase, and ornithine decarboxylase) were unchanged. In the acute murine model of allergic airway inflammation, augmentation of ARG1 expression was similarly the most dramatic change in protein expression. However, ARG2, NOS1, NOS2, and agmatinase were also increased, whereas NOS3 expression was decreased. Arginase inhibition in vivo with nebulized S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine attenuated the methacholine responsiveness of the central airways in mice from the acute model. Further investigations in the chronic murine model revealed an expression profile that more closely paralleled the human asthma samples: only ARG1 expression was significantly increased. Interestingly, in the chronic mouse model, which generates a remodeling phenotype, arginase inhibition attenuated methacholine responsiveness of the central and peripheral airways. The similarity in arginase expression between human asthma and the chronic model and the attenuation of AHR after in vivo treatment with an arginase inhibitor suggest the potential for therapeutic modification of arginase activity in asthma.

The genetic background to these mechanisms could be important effect modifiers. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess interactions between exposure to air pollution and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes for development of childhood allergic disease. METHODS: In a birth cohort originally of 4,089 children, we assessed air pollution from local traffic using nitrogen oxides (traffic NOx) as an indicator based on emission databases and dispersion modeling and estimated individual exposure through geocoding of home addresses. We measured peak expiratory flow rates and specific IgE for inhalant and food allergens at 4 years of age, and selected children with asthma symptoms up to 4 years of age (n = 542) and controls (n = 542) for genotyping. RESULTS: Interaction effects on allergic sensitization were indicated between several GSTP1 SNPs and traffic NO. exposure during the first year of life (P-nominal < 0.001-0.06). Children with Ile105Val/Val105Val genotypes were at increased risk of sensitization to any allergen when exposed to elevated levels of traffic NO, (for a difference between the 5th and 95th percentile of exposure: odds ratio = 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-5.3). In children with TNF-308 GA/AA genotypes, the GSTP1-NOx interaction effect was even more pronounced. We observed no conclusive interaction effects for ADRB2. CONCLUSION: The effect of air pollution from traffic on childhood allergy appears to be modified by GSTP1 and TNF variants, supporting a role of genes controlling the antioxidative system and inflammatory response in allergy.

Basal cells of differentiated bronchial epithelium are more susceptible to rhinovirus infection	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						airway epithelium; basal cells; rhinovirus; ICAM-1 expression	HUMAN AIRWAY EPITHELIUM; PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS; TRACHEAL EPITHELIUM; BARRIER FUNCTION; TIGHT JUNCTIONS; LUNG; PERMEABILITY; MECHANISMS; SECRETION	We used an in vitro model of differentiated tracheolbronchial epithelium to analyze the susceptibility of different cell types to infection with rhinoviruses (RVs). Primary cells from control subjects were cultured in an air-liquid interface to form differentiated epithelia. Suprabasal and basal fractions were separated after trypsin digestion, and cell suspensions were infected with serotypes RV16 and RVIA. These cell fractions were analyzed for expression of viral capsid protein VP2 (flow cytometry), viral replication (real-time PCR), cytolkeratin-14, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Compared with suprabasal fraction, basal cells had increased percentages of cells staining positive for VP2 (RVIA: 37.8% versus 9.1%, P < 0.01; RV16: 12.0 versus 3.0%, P < 0.05). The average number of viral RNA copies per cell was also higher in basal cells (2.2- and 2.4-fold increase in RV1A- and RV16-infected cells, respectively) compared with suprabasal cells. Furthermore, ICAM-1 was expressed by 33.3% of basal cells, compared with 8.1% of suprabasal cells (P < 0.05). Finally, in culture models of epithelial injury (detached suprabasal cells or scratched surface), there was significantly greater replication of RVIA compared with intact cell layer. These findings demonstrate that basal cells are more susceptible to RV infection than suprabasal cells. For major group RV, this may be in part due to increased expression of ICAM-1; however, minor group RV also replicated more effectively in basal cells. These results suggest the possibility that epithelial cell differentiation is associated with the maturation of antiviral defense mechanisms.

Objectives: Because much of the data are from high-risk cohorts, we undertook a birth cohort study in a complete population of children to test this association. Methods: Using Manitoba, Canada's, health care and prescription databases, this longitudinal study assessed the association between maternal distress during the first year of life and onward, and asthma at age 7 in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,907 children. Measurements and Main Results: Maternal distress was defined on the basis of health care or prescription medication use for depression or anxiety. Asthma status was derived from health care and prescription records for asthma, using a definition validated by comparison to pediatric allergist diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Independent of wellknown asthma risk factors, our population-based study of a non-high-risk cohort demonstrated an increased risk of childhood asthma (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55) among children exposed to continued maternal distress from birth until age 7. Exposure to maternal depression and anxiety limited to the first year of life did not have a demonstrable association with subsequent asthma. Of interest, we observed that the risk of asthma associated with continued maternal distress was increased in children living in high- versus low-income households (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85). Conclusions: Maternal distress in early life plays a role in the development of childhood asthma, especially if it continues beyond the postpartum period.

The purpose of this study is to review and discuss our experience with this condition. Methods: A descriptive, retrospective study of 41 cases - 34 men (83%) and 7 women (17%) - treated at our hospital for spontaneous pneumomediastinum from January 1990 through June 2006. Results: The mean age of the patients was 21 years (range, 14-35 years). Notably, 22% of patients had a prior history of asthma. No precipitating factor was identified in 51% of cases while onset was associated with physical effort in 12%. Chest pain (85%) and dyspnea (49%) were the most common symptoms. Subcutaneous emphysema, which presented in 71% of patients, was the most common sign. Pneumomediastinum was diagnosed by plain chest radiography in all cases. In certain cases, a computed tomography scan of the chest, contrast-enhanced swallow, or bronchoscopy was performed. All patients were admitted to the hospital with good progress and no instances of morbidity or mortality. Treatment included analgesia, rest, and/or initial oxygen therapy. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 1-9 days) with only one case of early recurrence, which was resolved satisfactorily. Conclusions: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a benign process primarily affecting young men. Despite its tow incidence, spontaneous pneumomediastinum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain because it requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with spontaneous preumomediastinum respond well to medical treatment, with no recurrence in the great majority of cases. (C) 2007 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

Coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) affects heart rate variability, blood lipids, and circulating eosinophils in adults with asthma	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						asthma; coarse PM; heart rate variability; inflammatory markers; lipids; systemic inflammation	AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; CARDIAC AUTONOMIC CONTROL; PHAGOCYTES IN-VIVO; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; ELDERLY SUBJECTS; ENDOTOXIN; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; ASSOCIATION	INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether markers of airway and systemic inflammation, as well as heart rate variability (HRV) in asthmatics, change in response to fluctuations in ambient particulate matter (PM) in the coarse [PM with aerodynamic diameter 2.5-10 mu M (PM2.5-10)] and fine (PM2.5) size range. METHODS: Twelve adult asthmatics, living within a 30-mile radius of an atmospheric monitoring site in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, were followed over a 12-week period. Daily PM2.5-10 and PM2.5 concentrations were measured separately for each 24-hr period. Each subject had nine clinic visits, at which spirometric measures and peripheral blood samples for analysis of lipids, inflammatory cells, and coagulation-associated proteins were obtained. We also assessed HRV [SDNN24HR (standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals in a 24-hr recording), ASDNN5 (mean of the standard deviation in A 5-min segments of a 24-hr recording)] with four consecutive 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiogram measurements. Linear mixed models with a spatial covariance matrix structure and a 1-day lag were used to assess potential associations between PM levels and cardio- pulmonary end points. RESULTS: For a 1-mu g/m(3) increase in coarse PM, SDNN24HR, and ASDNN5 decreased 3.36% (p 0.02), and 0.77%, (p = 0.05) respectively. With a 1-mu g/m(3) increase in coarse PM, circulating eosinophils increased 0.16% (p = 0.01), triglycerides increased 4.8% (p = 0.02), and very low-density lipoprotein increased 1.15% (p = 0.01). No significant associations were found with fine PM, and none with lung function. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that small temporal increases in ambient coarse PM are sufficient to affect important cardiopulmonary and lipid parameters in adults with asthma.

Serum pneumoproteins were used as lung-specific biomarkers of effect. Design: EBC was obtained from 50 healthy subjects, 30 healthy smokers, 30 asthmatics, and 50 patients with stable COPD, and was collected by cooling exhaled air. Trace elements and toxic metals in the samples were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy. The serum pneumoproteins were immuno-assayed. Results: The EBC of COPD subjects had higher levels of such toxic elements as lead, cadmium, and aluminum, and lower levels of iron and copper, than that of the nonsmoking control subjects. There were no between-group differences in surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-B levels. Clara-cell protein and SP-D levels were negatively and positively influenced, respectively, by tobacco smoke. Conclusions: Our results show that toxic metals and transition elements are detectable in the EBC of studied subjects. We propose new biomarkers of exposure as a means of assessing the target tissue dose of carcinogenic and pneumotoxic substances from tobacco smoke or polluted workplaces, and the use of the transition elements involved in redox systems of oxidative stress as disease biomarkers associated with effect or susceptibility. Together with biomarkers of effect, such as serum pneumoproteins, the elemental composition of EBC may be clinically useful in distinguishing similar diseases.

However, less is known about these exposures and the development of asthma symptoms in adolescence. Methods: Data were taken from the Mater University Study, of Pregnancy, a large birth cohort study of mothers and children enrolled in Brisbane, Australia, beginning in 1981. Smoking was assessed at 2 stages during pregnancy and at the 6-month and 5-year follow-up visits. Asthma was assessed from maternal reports that were provided when the child was age 14 years. We conducted multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to assess the effect of maternal smoking on asthma symptoms. Results: There was a strong sex interaction such that girls whose mothers had smoked heavily (20 or more cigarettes per day) in pregnancy and at the 6-month follow up had increased odds of experiencing asthma symptoms at age 14 (odds ratio = 1.96; 95% confidence interval = 1.25-3.08). The contribution of heavy smoking during pregnancy appeared to be stronger than heavy smoking after the birth. No similar associations were seen for boys. Conclusion: Female adolescents whose mothers smoked heavily during the fetal period and the early months of life have increased risk of asthma symptoms in adolescence. In utero exposure to heavy smoking was found to have a stronger effect than postnatal environmental tobacco exposure.

A prospective multi-centre study	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						asthma; clinical database; immunotherapy; rhinitis; side-effects	SYSTEMIC REACTIONS; EXTRACT; SAFETY; EFFICACY	Background and objective The safety of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a parameter of great interest in the overall assessment of the treatment. A clinical database was developed in order to obtain early warnings of changes in the frequency and severity of side-effects and sufficient data for the evaluation of possible risk factors. Methods During a 3-year period, four allergy centres in Copenhagen, Denmark, included data from all patients initiating SIT to a common database. Information on initial allergic symptoms, allergens used for treatment, treatment regimens and systemic side-effects (SSEs) during the build-up phase was collected. Results A total of 1038 patients received treatment with 1709 allergens (timothy, birch, mugwort, house dust mite (HDM), cat, and wasp and bee venom), 23 047 injections in total. Most SIT patients completed the updosing phase without side-effects, but there was a significant difference between allergens: wasp (89%), birch (82%), HDM (81%), cat (74%) and grass (70%) (P=0.004). A total of 582 SSEs were registered in 341 patients. Most side-effects were mild grade 2 reactions (78%). A difference in severity between allergens was observed (P=0.02), with grass giving most problems. The type of allergen but not patient- or centre-related parameters seemed predictive of side-effects. Conclusions Allergen extracts differ in their tendency to produce side-effects. Multi-centre studies like the present one allow more patients to be evaluated, and thereby provide a more efficient surveillance of side-effects. Online Internet-based registration to a central national database of every allergen injection would be an even more powerful tool for evaluation of risk factors and surveillance of side-effects.

Objective: The aim of the study was to comparatively analyse a new component-based allergen-microarray and the 'quasi-standard' ImmunoCAP((R)) for their clinical relevance in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to five aeroallergens [house dust mite (HDM), cat dander, birch, grass and mugwort pollen] in a prospective, double-centre study. Methods: We enrolled 120 subjects at the two study centres. Allergic patients were defined as having an allergen-specific history plus a concomitant positive skin-prick test (SPT) to natural allergen extracts and specific serum IgE was measured by both methods. Each allergen was analysed separately. Results: The microarray performed equally well in receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses when compared with the CAP in cat (23 allergic vs 97 non-allergic, ROC area under the curve microarray 0.950 vs CAP 0.894, P = 0.211), birch (31/89, 0.908 vs 0.878, P = 0.483) and grass pollen (47/73, 0.923 vs 0.915, P = 0.770). It was slightly less sensitive in HDM-allergic subjects (26 allergic vs 94 non-allergic, ROC area microarray 0.808 vs CAP 0.911, P = 0.053) and displayed a reduced sensitivity in the mugwort pollen-allergic patients (17/103, 0.723 vs 0.879, P = 0.032). Conclusions: Component-based testing and the whole-allergen CAP are equally relevant in the diagnosis of grass-, birch- and cat-allergic patients. Although slightly less sensitive, the microarray is sufficient for the diagnosis of HDM-allergic patients, but needs alternative and/or additional components for detecting mugwort allergy.

COPD is rarely considered in persons with no smoking history except in the context of another exposure. Accordingly, the disease has not been well characterized in these "never smokers." METHODS: We evaluated airway obstruction (defined as forced expiratory Volume in I second/forced vital capacity < 0.70) in US adults aged 30 to 80 years interviewed in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with valid spirometry who had never smoked. Previously described risk factors were examined for their association with obstruction in bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Never smokers represented 42% of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Population aged 30 to 80 years, with obstruction prevalence of 91 per 1000. Never smokers accounted for 4.56 million cases of obstruction, or 23% of the total burden. Among these obstructed never smokers, 19% reported a prior diagnosis of asthma alone, and 12.5% reported COPD (alone or with asthma), leaving 68.5% with no prior respiratory diagnosis. After adjustment for other factors, hi, her rates of obstruction were significantly associated with increasing age, male sex. lower body mass index, and a history of allergies. CONCLUSIONS: Never smokers represent a significant proportion of airway obstruction in US adults. Only one fifth of obstruction in this group is explained by asthma. COPD may explain much of the remainder, although known risk factors were not explanatory in this dataset. Recommendations that lung health screening programs be limited to smokers should be reconsidered. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Advice is variable and often inadequate; further reactions are common. There is no consensus on the criteria for prescription of rescue medication, particularly adrenaline. A longitudinal prospective and case-control study in a tertiary allergy clinic. Patients/parents/school staff of 747 children with confirmed peanut or tree nut allergy received detailed verbal and written advice on nut avoidance, training in recognition and (self-) treatment of reactions and a written treatment plan. The severity of nut allergy was graded (mild-severe) and emergency medication was allocated according to our criteria: all received oral antihistamines, injected adrenaline (EpiPen) was given to those with reactions with airway narrowing, milder reactions to low-dose exposure or concomitant asthma. At annual follow-up over 25 906 patient-months (median: 39 months) retraining was given and details of further reactions (frequency, severity and treatment) were obtained. Criteria for allocation of EpiPen were evaluated. The worst reaction pre-enrolment was mild in 64% and moderate/severe in 36% (airway narrowing). Of 615 subjects followed up, 21% had a further reaction (eightfold reduction in frequency), mostly mild. There was a 60-fold reduction in the frequency of severe reactions. Of those with a moderate-severe initial reaction, 99.5% had no or a less severe follow-up reaction. No child with a mild or severe index reaction had a severe follow-up reaction. Only 1/615 (0.2%) had a severe follow-up reaction and only 2/615 (0.3%) used adrenaline, both successfully and had it available according to our criteria. Of mild-moderate reactions, 77% required oral antihistamines alone and 15% no treatment. Children who had follow-up reactions had more frequent and severe reactions pre-enrolment. The management plan greatly reduced the frequency and severity of further reactions and was successful for all children. Our criteria for selective prescription of EpiPen in the context of this management plan were appropriate. This is the first study to provide evidence on which to inform practice.

Here we demonstrate that CD4(+) T cells, central to chronic airway inflammation, drive ASM remodeling in experimental asthma. Adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells from sensitized rats induced an increase in proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis of airway myocytes in naive recipients upon repeated antigen challenge, which resulted in an increase in ASM mass. Genetically modified CD4(+) T cells expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP) were localized by confocal microscopy in juxtaposition to ASM cells, which suggests that CD4(+) T cells may modulate ASM cell function through direct cell-cell interaction in vivo. Coculture of antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells with cell cycle-arrested ASM cells induced myocyte proliferation, dependent on T cell activation and direct T cell-myocyte contact. Reciprocally, direct cell contact prevented postactivation T cell apoptosis, which suggests receptor-mediated T cell-myocyte crosstalk. Overall, our data demonstrate that activated CD4(+) T cells drive ASM remodeling in experimental asthma and suggest that a direct cell-cell interaction participates in CD4(+) T cell regulation of myocyte turnover and induction of remodeling.

The interaction with the human body of such nanoparticles has been investigated, with a particular emphasis on innate defence mechanisms. Human macrophages (PMA-differentiated myelomonocytic U-937 cells) were exposed in vitro to non-toxic concentrations of TiO2 SiO2 ZrO2 or Co nanoparticles, and their inflammatory response (expression of TLR receptors and co-receptors, and cytokine production) was examined. Expression of TLR receptors was generally unaffected by exposure to the different nanoparticles, except for some notable cases. Exposure to nanoparticles of ZrO2 (and to a lesser extent TiO2), upregulated expression of viral TLR receptors TLR3 and TLR7. Expression of TLR10 was also increased by TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles. On the other hand, TLR9 expression was decreased by SiO2 nanoparticles, and expression of the co-receptor CD14 was inhibited by Co nanoparticles. Basal and LPS-induced production of cytokines 1L-1beta, TNF-alpha, and 1L-1Ra was examined in macrophages exposed to nanoparticles. SiO2 nanoparticles strongly biased naive macrophages towards inflammation (M1 polarisation), by selectively inducing production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. SiO2 nanoparticles also significantly amplified the inflammatory phenotype of LPS-polarised M1 macrophages. Other ceramic nanoparticles had little influence on cytokine production, either in resting macrophages, or in LPS-activated cells. Generally, Co nanoparticles had an overall pro-inflammatory effect on naive macrophages, by reducing anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra and inducing inflammatory TNF-alpha. However, Co nanoparticles reduced production of IL-1beta and IL-1Ra, but not TNF-alpha, in LPS-polarised M1 macrophages. Thus, exposure to different nanoparticles can modulate, in different ways, the defence/inflammatory capacities of macrophages. A thorough analysis of these biasing effects may shed light on the mechanisms of pathogensis of several diseases based on dysregulation of the immune response (allergies, autoimmunity, tumours).

Aims: To systematically review the results of such studies in children, estimate summary measures of effect, and investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Methods: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases to June 2002, including those where outcomes and particulate level measurements were made at least daily for greater than or equal to 8 weeks, and analysed using an appropriate regression model. Study results were compared using forest plots, and fixed and random effects summary effect estimates obtained. Publication bias was considered using a funnel plot. Results: Twenty two studies were identified, all except two reporting PM10 (24 hour mean) >50 mug. m(-3). Reported effects of PM10 on PEF were widely spread and smaller than those for PM2.5 (fixed effects summary: -0.012 v -0.063 l. min(-1) per mug. m(-3) rise). A similar pattern was evident for symptoms. Random effects models produced larger estimates. Overall, in between-study comparisons, panels of children with diagnosed asthma or pre-existing respiratory symptoms appeared less affected by PM10 levels than those without, and effect estimates were larger where studies were conducted in higher ozone conditions. Larger PM10 effect estimates were obtained from studies using generalised estimating equations to model autocorrelation and where results were derived by pooling subject specific regression coefficients. A funnel plot of PM10 results for PEF was markedly asymmetrical. Conclusions: The majority of identified studies indicate an adverse effect of particulate air pollution that is greater for PM2.5 than PM10. However, results show considerable heterogeneity and there is evidence consistent with publication bias, so limited confidence may be placed on summary estimates of effect. The possibility of interaction between particle and ozone effects merits further investigation, as does variability due to analytical differences that alter the interpretation of final estimates.

Objective: To investigate the extent of oral absorption and bioavailability of ciclesonide referenced to an intravenous infusion. This information provides an estimate for the contribution of the swallowed fraction to systemic exposure to ciclesonide after oral inhalation. Methods: In a randomised crossover study, six healthy male subjects (age range 19-40 years) received single doses of 6.9mg (oral administration) and 0.64mg (intravenous administration) of [C-14]ciclesonide, separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. Total radioactivity was determined in whole blood, plasma, urine and faeces. Serum concentrations of ciclesonide and its major metabolite, the pharmacologically active desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), were determined in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Results: After a 10-minute intravenous infusion, the mean half-life for total radioactivity was 45.2 hours. Elimination of des-CIC was fast with a mean elimination half-life of 3.5 hours. After oral administration, the mean half-life for total radioactivity was 27.5 hours. On the basis of a comparison of dose-normalised areas under the curve of total plasma radioactivity versus time, 24.5% of orally administered [C-14]ciclesonide was absorbed. The parent compound ciclesonide was not detected in any of the serum samples after oral administration; serum concentrations of des-CIC were mostly near or below the lower limit of quantification. Thus, systemic bioavailability for des-CIC is <1 % and the absolute bioavailability of ciclesonide is even less than this. [C-14]Ciclesonide showed no retention in red blood cells. The mean cumulative excretion of total radioactivity was almost complete by 120 hours after oral and intravenous administration. Faecal excretion was the predominant route of excretion for total radioactivity after both routes of administration. Single oral and intravenous administration of ciclesonide was well tolerated. Conclusions: Because of an almost complete first-pass metabolism, ciclesonide is undetectable in serum after oral administration. Thus, any ciclesonide swallowed after oral inhalation does not contribute to systemically available ciclesonide or to its active metabolite. Drug-related metabolites are excreted mainly via the faeces, and overall recovery of administered radioactivity is virtually complete after an extended sample collection period.

Ultrafine particles (particles less than 0.1 mum in diameter) may contribute to these adverse effects because they have a higher predicted pulmonary deposition, greater potential to induce pulmonary inflammation, larger surface area, and enhanced oxidant capacity when compared with larger particles on a mass basis. We hypothesized that ultrafine particle exposure Would induce airway inflammation in susceptible humans. This hypothesis was tested in a series of randomized, double-blind studies by exposing healthy subjects and mild asthmatic subjects to carbon ultrafine particles versus filtered air. Both exposures were delivered via a mouthpiece system during rest and moderate exercise. Healthy subjects were exposed to particle concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 mug/m(3), while asthmatics were exposed to 10 mug/m(3). Lung function and airway inflammation were assessed by symptom scores, pulmonary function tests, and airway nitric oxide parameters. Airway inflammatory cells were measured via induced sputum analysis in several of the protocols. There were no differences in any of these measurements in normal or asthmatic subjects when exposed to ultrafine particles at concentrations of 10 or 25 mug/m(3). However, exposing 16 normal subjects to the higher concentration of 50 mug/m(3) caused a reduction in maximal midexpiratory flow rate (-4.34 +/- 1.78% [ultrafine particles] vs. +1.08 +/- 1.86% [air], p =.042) and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (-1.76 +/- 0.66 ml/min/mm Hg [ultrafine particles] vs. -0.18 +/- 0.41 ml/min/mm Hg [air], p =.040) at 21 h after exposure. There were no consistent differences in symptoms, induced sputum, or exhaled nitric oxide parameters in any of these studies. These results suggest that exposure to carbon ultrafine particles results in mild small-airways dysfunction together with impaired alveolar gas exchange in normal subjects. These effects do not appear related to airway inflammation. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings in normal subjects, compare them with additional susceptible patient populations, and determine their pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Within minutes of allergen exposure, immune cells release histamine, proteases, cysteinyl leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines. Some produce the early symptoms, while others augment the production, systemic circulation, and subsequent infiltration of the nasal mucosa with inflammatory cells that sustain the symptoms. Systemic circulation of inflammatory cells permits their infiltration into other tissues where chemoattractant and adhesion molecules already exist. Consequently, allergic rhinitis is linked to comorbid conditions: asthma, chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis, nasal pollyposis, and serous otitis media. Effective therapy should be directed at underlying inflammation and its systemic manifestations. It should improve the rhinitis and the comorbid conditions. Antihistamines relieve early symptoms by blocking basophil- and mast cell-generated histamine, but they do not significantly influence the pro-inflammatory loop. They are often little better than placebo. Oral corticosteroids provide the systemic anti-inflammatory efficacy, but their toxicity precludes such an approach. Intranasal corticosteroids effectively target the local inflammatory processes of rhinitis, reducing local inflammatory cells within the nares, but they do not directly access tissues involved in the comorbid conditions. Leukotriene modifiers have both systemic anti-inflammatory effects and an acceptable safety profile.

Respiratory mechanics and airway responsiveness to methacholine were assessed in A/J mice 24 hours after a 5-minute exposure to 100, 200, 400, or 800 ppm Cl-2 and 2 and 7 days after inhalation of 400 ppm Cl-2. Airway responsiveness was higher 24 hours after 400 and 800 ppm Cl-2. Responsiveness after inhalation of 400 ppm Cl-2 returned to normal by 2 days but was again elevated at 7 days. Airway epithelial loss, patchy alveolar damage, proteinaceous exudates, and inflammatory cells within alveolar walls were observed in animals exposed to 800 ppm Cl-2. Macrophages, granulocytes, epithelial cells, and nitrate/nitrite levels increased in lung lavage fluid. Increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and oxidation of lung proteins were observed. Epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from mice exposed to 800 ppm Cl-2 stained for 3-nitrotyrosine residues. Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase with 1400W (1 mg/kg) abrogated the Cl-2-induced changes in responsiveness. We conclude that chlorine exposure causes functional and pathological changes in the airways associated with oxidative stress. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is involved in the induction of changes in responsiveness to methacholine.

CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						atopy; children; epidemiology; farm; risk factors; skin prick test	FATTY-ACIDS; HAY-FEVER; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; BIRTH COHORT; ASTHMA; CHILDHOOD; ENDOTOXIN; EXPOSURE; ENVIRONMENT; COMMUNITY	Background: The inverse association between farming and atopy in children has been attributed to microbial exposure, especially through livestock. Very little is known about other potential explanatory factors. Objective: To explore potential differences in lifestyle and environmental factors between farmer and non-farmer families, and whether these factors could explain the association between farming and childhood atopy. Methods: A cross-sectional study, including 366 farmers' and 344 non-farmers' children in eastern Finland. Information regarding exposure and background characteristics was gathered by a written questionnaire. Atopy was defined as having one or more positive skin prick test reactions (> 3 mm) against the six common aeroallergens. Results: Regardless of the current farming type, atopy was less frequent among the farmers' children than the non-farmers' children (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.78). Remarkable differences were seen in many lifestyle factors (including diet) between the farmer and non-farmer families, but only a few of the explored factors were associated with atopy. The frequency of current livestock contacts seemed to have an inverse, dose-dependent association with atopy (aOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.97 for daily vs. no contact). Having lived on a dairy farm in infancy (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93), or having had cats or dogs in infancy (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.85), decreased the risk of atopy at school age. The inverse association between farming and atopy was not explained by the sociodemographic factors, or by differences in conventional risk factors of atopy. Animal contacts explained partially, but not completely, the association. Conclusion Higher frequency of animal contacts is one factor, but probably not the only one, explaining the inverse association of farming and atopy in children.

Information regarding history of asthma and hay fever was collected by questionnaire from 3,308 cancer-free participants in the 1981 Busselton Health Survey. A subset of 1,005 participants also underwent skin-prick testing. The cohort was followed for a new diagnosis of cancer or death until the end of 1999. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (relative risks) for breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, and hematologic cancers and melanoma. Having a skin reaction to house dust mites nearly tripled the risk of prostate cancer (relative risk=2.90, 95% confidence interval: 1.26, 6.68). History of asthma and hay fever were associated with a trend toward a reduced risk of colorectal cancer and increased risk of leukemia, but these results were not statistically significant. Hay fever was associated with melanoma risk in men but not in women. No association was found between breast and lung cancers and allergic disorders or atopy.

Thirty-two centers throughout Italy participated in the study, Over a 6-month period (November 1, 1999 to April 30, 2000), we evaluated all children < 2 years of age hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections. All subjects were tested for RSV within 24 hr of hospitalization by using an immuno-enzymatic diagnostic test (Abbott Testpack, RSV). Logistic regression was used to identify the factors that might be associated with more severe disease or could increase the likelihood of RSV positivity in hospitalized infants. Out of a total of 1,232 children enrolled, 40.6% were found to be RSV-posftive (RSV+). The peak of the RSV epidemic occurred in February, while the lowest prevalence of RSV positivity was seen in November (P < 0.05). A high proportion of study subjects had low birth weight and low gestational age. The clinical diagnosis at hospitalization was bronchiolitis in 66.7%, pneumonia in 15.3%, and wheezy bronchitis in 18.1%. In the bronchiolitis group, a higher prevalence of RSV+ was found in patients with gestational age less than or equal to 33 weeks or 34-35 weeks, as compared to those with agestational age > 36 weeks (P < 0.04). No differences were found in the proportion of RSV+ patients in the three gestational age subgroups with pneumonia and wheezy bronchitis (P > 0.05, each comparison). Independent of the clinical diagnosis at admission, RSV infection was associated with more severe respiratory impairment. Environmental smoke exposure was higher in subjects with bronchiolitis than in those with wheezy bronchitis (P < 0.04), and RSV 4 was positively related with the birth order (P < 0.05). The presence of older siblings and birth order plays an important role in RSV infection. The collected data show that, in Italy, RSV is an important cause of lower respiratory tractinfection in infants. Gestational age, birth order, birth weight, and exposure to tobacco smoke affected the prevalence and severity of RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease. (C) Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Specific immunotherapy (IT) reduces mucosal eosinophilia and numbers of metachromatic cells in the epithelium. A specific marker distinguishing basophils from mast cells was recently developed. Objectives The basophil-specific manoclanal antibody 2D7 was used to determine the influence of subcutaneous IT on numbers of nasal mucosal basophils compared with the effects of IT on neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells. Method During a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of grass pollen IT in 44 adults with severe summer hay fever, nasal biopsies were taken at baseline, out of the pollen season, and at the peak of the pollen season following 2 years treatment. Biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry far basophils (2D7(+)), mast cells (AA1(+)), eosinophils (MBP+) and neutrophils (neutrophil elastase(+)). Results In placebo-treated (PL) patients there were significant seasonal increases in basophils (P<0.01), mast cells (P<0.05) and eosinophils (P=0.002) irt the nasal submucosa. In IT-treated patients significant increases in 2D7 cells (P<0.01) and eosinophils (P=0.01) but not AA1(+) cells (P=0.9) were observed. These differences were significant between groups for eosinophils (P<0.05). In the epithelium there were seasonal increases in AA1(+) cells and eosinophils in both groups (PL: P<0.01, IT: P<0.05 far both). The between-group difference was significant for eosinophils (P=0.05). Basophils were observed in the epithelium of six out of 17 in the placebo group and one out of 20 in the IT group (P=0.03). Neutrophil numbers remained constant in both epithelium and submucosa. Conclusion Successful grass pollen immunotherapy was associated with inhibition of seasonal increases in basophils and eosinophils, but not mast cells or neutrophils within the nasal epithelium. Immunotherapy may act, at least in part, by reducing seasonal recruitment of basophils and eosinophils into the epithelium.

Blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) specimens were respectively performed via an internal jugular vein catheter and a nonbronchoscopic BAL for baseline oxidative activity measurements: malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). A 4-h general anesthesia was then performed in the three groups of 10 swine: the Propofol group received 8 mg(.)kg(-1.)h(-1) of IV propofol as the sole anesthetic; the Desflurane group received 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of desflurane; and the Sevoflurane group received 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane. We observed significantly larger levels of MDA in plasma and BAL during desflurane exposure than with the other anesthetics. We also observed smaller concentrations of circulating GPX and alveolar GPX We found a significant decrease for MDA measurements in the plasma and the pulmonary lavage during propofol anesthesia. We also found larger values of GPX measurements in the serum and the pulmonary lavage. No significant changes were observed when animals were exposed to sevoflurane. No significant changes were found for circulating concentrations of SOD during exposure to all anesthetics. In this mechanically ventilated swine model, desflurane seemed to induce a local and systemic oxidative stress, whereas propofol and sevoflurane were more likely to have antioxidant properties.

Individual factors that may enhance susceptibility to the effects of home dampness are mainly unknown. Methods-The association between home dampness and current physician diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, common colds, and bacterial respiratory infections was studied in a questionnaire survey of 10 667 Finnish first year university students aged 18-25 years. The dampness categories analysed were visible mould and visible mould or damp stains or water damage during the last year. In multivariate analyses adjustment was made for parental education, active and passive smoking, type and place of residence, pets, and wall to wall carpets. The interaction effect of atopic heredity and dampness was investigated. Results-Visible mould or damp stains or water damage was reported by 15.0% of the respondents. In multivariate models there was a positive association between home dampness and current asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, as well as common colds greater than or equal to4 times per year and other respiratory infections, but not between home dampness and allergic conjunctivitis. The strongest association was found between exposure to visible mould and asthma (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.28) and common colds (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.87). The risk of current asthma in damp homes was highest among subjects with atopic heredity. Conclusions-The risk of current asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis was higher in damp homes. Of the respiratory infections, the risk of common colds was most clearly increased.

Currently, fungal extracts used for diagnosis in the United States are unstandardized, and their allergenic content cannot be compared directly. Objective: The goal of this study was to compare the variability of major allergen levels among US allergenic products derived from fungi: specifically, Alt a 1 levels in Alternaria alternata extracts, and Asp f 1 levels in A fumigatus extracts. Methods: A novel a-site monoclonal antibody ELISA was used for measuring Alt a 1 using recombinant Alt a 1 as a standard. Asp fl was also measured by ELISA, Allergenic products produced by 8 US manufacturers over a 2-year period were compared, as were multiple lots produced by a single company, Results: Alt a 1 levels in Alternaria extracts from 8 companies produced in 1998 and 1999 ranged from less than 0.01 to 6.09 mug/mL (mean 1.4 +/- 1.6 mug/mL, n = 15), In general, Alt al levels were consistent within and between companies (1.4 +/- 1.1 mug/mL, n = 27), with 21 of 32 (66%) of all extracts tested containing 0.7 to 2 mug/mL Alt a 1, Aspergillus extracts showed much greater variability in Asp fl levels, with extracts from 8 companies containing from less than 0.1 to 64 mug/mL Asp fl (mean 16.3 +/- 23.9 mug/mL, n = 15), Overall variability was greater for Aspergillus products within and between manufacturers (22 +/- 22 mug/mL Asp f 1, a = 20), Conclusions: ELISA-based assays for specific allergens showed greater consistency among allergenic products derived from Alternaria than from Aspergillus, These assays should facilitate improved quality control and standardization of fungal allergen extracts and lead to the development of more consistent products for clinical use.

Our aim was to study the clinical outcome of diisocyanate-induced asthma, A questionnaire was sent to the 235 patients alive in 7995, and validated by reexamining clinically 91 of them. The study was carried out on average 10 (3-19) yr after the diagnosis. Of the patients 82% experienced symptoms of asthma, 34% used no medication, and 35% were on regular medication. The patients having displayed immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to isocyanates used less medication (OR 0.273; Cl 0.098, 0.758) and had fewer symptoms of asthma (OR 0.329; Cl 0.124, 0.875) than the IgE-negative ones. They also had a significantly shorter duration of symptoms (p = 0.0025), latency period (p = 0.0249), and duration of exposure (p = 0.0008) than the IgE-negative patients. This did not, however, entirely explain the more favourable outcome of the IgE-positive patients. Patients with HDI-induced asthma used less medication (OR 0.412; Cl 0.229, 0.739) than patients with MDI- and TDI-induced asthma. The results confirm the generally rather poor medical outcome of diisocyanate-induced asthma; the persistence of symptoms and unspecific bronchial reactivity were pronounced in TDI-induced asthma. A more favourable outcome was associated with IgE mediation and HDI inducement.

We have shown in a Brown Norway (BN) rat model of house dust mite (HDM) allergy that preexposure to residual oil By ash (ROFA) particles enhanced the sensitization phase such that the secondary immune response and associated lung injury were increased after allergen challenge. To determine whether the metals present in ROFA mediated this effect, BN rats were intratracheally instilled with either ROFA (1000 mu g) or acidified saline + NiSO4 (105.12 mu g), VSO4 (98.2 mu g), FeSO4 (58.49 mu g), or a mixture (Mix) of each metal. HDM-specific IgE was higher in the serum of the ROFA, Ni, V, and Mix groups than in the HDM group after challenge, and antigen-induced bronchoconstriction responses were increased in the Ni group. Lymphocyte proliferation to antigen was increased in the ROFA, Ni, and V groups compared to controls. Total protein and eosinophil peroxidase levels were elevated in the Fe group, and eosinophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were increased in the ROFA and Fe groups compared to HDM control. IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression was also increased in the lung tissue of all metal and ROFA-treated groups, while BALF IL-10 was elevated in the Fe and Mix groups, and IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated in the metal and ROFA-treated groups compared to controls. These results suggest that ROFA's metallic constituents mediate enhancement of sensitization to HDM and that pulmonary inflammation may play a role in this adjuvant effect. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Much research is currently being conducted in an attempt to identify possible reasons for this occurrence. A so-called Western lifestyle has been the factor most commonly cited to explain this worrying increase in asthma prevalence. In essence, this implies a way of life where children are exposed from early infancy to a wide range of foods, infections, indoor and outdoor allergens, and irritants and to the effects of motor vehicle pollution, Until fairly recently, children in many African countries lived mainly in rural areas and were not exposed to the effects of a Western lifestyle, Early studies in a limited number of African countries showed a very low rural prevalence of childhood asthma, especially where children lived according to a traditional lifestyle, These same studies showed that asthma was not uncommon in urbanized African children. There has been an increasing tendency over the past 20 years for those in rural communities to move to the large urban centers. More recent childhood asthma prevalence studies, especially those from Kenya and Ghana, have confirmed the urban-rural differences but have shown a much narrower gap. In part this may be the result of exposure of rural children to agricultural pesticides and irritants as well as of an increasing tendency to adopt a more Westernized lifestyle such as the use of beds with mattresses, pillows, and blankets, These circumstances on the African continent provide a natural laboratory in the quest for factors that influence the development of asthma in susceptible children, Once more fully elucidated, it is possible that much valuable information will be available to combat the relentless increase in childhood asthma both here as well as in the developed world.

Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with challenge-proven food allergy in infants	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Vitamin D; food allergy; peanut allergy; egg allergy; population; oral food challenge; eczema; epigenetic	REGULATORY T-CELLS; UNITED-STATES; BIRTH COHORT; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN; LATITUDE; RADIATION; EXPOSURE; SEASON	Background: Epidemiological evidence has shown that pediatric food allergy is more prevalent in regions further from the equator, suggesting that vitamin D insufficiency may play a role in this disease. Objective: To investigate the role of vitamin D status in infantile food allergy. Methods: A population sample of 5276 one-year-old infants underwent skin prick testing to peanut, egg, sesame, and cow's milk or shrimp. All those with a detectable wheal and a random sample of participants with negative skin prick test results attended a hospital-based food challenge clinic. Blood samples were available for 577 infants (344 with challenge-proven food allergy, 74 sensitized but tolerant to food challenge, 159 negative on skin prick test and food challenge). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and food allergy were examined by using multiple logistic regression, adjusting for potential risk and confounding factors. Results: Infants of Australian-born parents, but not of parents born overseas, with vitamin D insufficiency (<= 50 nmol/L) were more likely to be peanut (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 11.51; 95% CI, 2.01-65.79; P = .006) and/or egg (aOR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.1912.08; P = .025) allergic than were those with adequate vitamin D levels independent of eczema status. Among those with Australian-born parents, infants with vitamin D insufficiency were more likely to have multiple food allergies (>= 2) rather than a single food allergy (aOR, 10.48; 95% CI, 1.60-68.61 vs aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.38-8.77, respectively). Conclusions: These results provide the first direct evidence that vitamin D sufficiency may be an important protective factor for food allergy in the first year of life.

For example, allergen contact first occurs at mucosal sites exposed to the external environment, such as the skin, airways, and gastrointestinal tract. This exposure leads to the production of a variety of cytokines and chemokines that are involved in driving allergic inflammatory responses. One such product is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Recent studies in both human subjects and murine models have implicated TSLP in the development and progression of allergic diseases. This review will highlight recent advances in the understanding of the role of TSLP in these inflammatory diseases. Importantly, these insights into TSLP's multifaceted role could potentially allow for novel therapeutic manipulations of these disorders. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2012; 130:845-52.)

Vitamin D Insufficiency and Severe Asthma Exacerbations in Puerto Rican Children	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						vitamin D; asthma exacerbations; Puerto Ricans; childhood	GENETIC ANCESTRY; AFRICAN ANCESTRY; LUNG-FUNCTION; INDUCTION; EXPOSURE; POPULATIONS; PREDICTORS; ADMIXTURE; MARKERS; ADULTS	Rationale: Vitamin D insufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml) has been associated with severe asthma exacerbations, but this could be explained by underlying racial ancestry or disease severity. Little is known about vitamin D and asthma in Puerto Ricans. Objectives To examine whether vitamin D insufficiency is associated with severe asthma exacerbations in Puerto Rican children, independently of racial ancestry, atopy, and time outdoors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 560 children ages 6-14 years with (n = 287) and without (n = 273) asthma in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We measured plasma vitamin D and estimated the percentage of African racial ancestry among participants using genome-wide genotypic data. We tested whether vitamin D insufficiency is associated with severe asthma exacerbations, lung function, or atopy (greater than or equal to one positive IgE to allergens) using logistic or linear regression. Multivariate models were adjusted for African ancestry, time outdoors, atopy, and other covariates. Measurements and Main Results Vitamin D insufficiency was common in children with (44%) and without (47%) asthma. In multivariate analyses, vitamin D insufficiency was associated with higher odds of greater than or equal to one severe asthma exacerbation in the prior year (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.9; P = 0.001) and atopy, and a lower FEV1/FVC in cases. After stratification by atopy, the magnitude of the association between vitamin D insufficiency and severe exacerbations was greater in nonatopic (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2-21.6; P = 0.002) than in atopic (OR, 2; 95% CI, 1-4.1; P = 0.04) cases. Conclusions Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with severe asthma exacerbations in Puerto Rican children, independently of racial ancestry, atopy, or markers of disease severity or control.

Trefoil factor 2 rapidly induces interleukin 33 to promote type 2 immunity during allergic asthma and hookworm infection	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							IN-VIVO; AIRWAY HYPERREACTIVITY; DENDRITIC CELLS; ACUTE SCHISTOSOMIASIS; CYTOKINE PRODUCTION; HELMINTH INFECTION; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; EFFECTOR FUNCTION; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; T-CELLS	The molecular mechanisms that drive mucosal T helper type 2 (T(H)2) responses against parasitic helminths and allergens remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate in mice that TFF2 (trefoil factor 2), an epithelial cell-derived repair molecule, is needed for the control of lung injury caused by the hookworm parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and for type 2 immunity after infection. TFF2 is also necessary for the rapid production of IL-33, a T(H)2-promoting cytokine, by lung epithelia, alveolar macrophages, and inflammatory dendritic cells in infected mice. TFF2 also increases the severity of allergic lung disease caused by house dust mite antigens or IL-13. Moreover, TFF2 messenger RNA expression is significantly increased in nasal mucosal brushings during asthma exacerbations in children. These experiments extend the biological functions of TFF2 from tissue repair to the initiation and maintenance of mucosal T(H)2 responses.

We investigated whether gut-tropic T cells that express the integrin alpha 4 beta 7 and the chemokine receptor CCR9 are required for OT. METHODS: Skin delayed-type hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were used to monitor OT in mice. To assess the role of receptors that mediate localization of lymphocytes to the gut (gut-homing receptors) in induction of OT, we studied CCR9(-/-) and beta 7(-/-) mice and also blocked the alpha 4 beta 7 ligand MAdCAM-1 in wild-type mice. We used DEREG and Scurfy mice to assess the role of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-10(-/-) and IL-10R beta(-/-) mice to examine the role of interleukin (IL)-10 in induction of OT. RESULTS: OT could not be induced in CCR9(-/-) or beta 7(-/-) mice, or when MAdCAM-1 was blocked in wild-type mice, indicating that gut-homing receptors are required for oral tolerization. Consistent with the role of all-trans retinoic acid in inducing gut-homing T cells, OT could not be induced in mice depleted of vitamin A. OT was rescued in CCR9(-/-) mice following adoptive transfer of wild-type T cells, but not CCR9(-/-) or beta 7(-/-) T cells. Gut-homing T cells are therefore necessary and sufficient to induce OT. Wild-type Treg and IL-10 were required to restore OT to CCR9-/- mice, indicating that homing and functional differentiation of IL-10-producing Treg in the gut is required for OT. Conversely, transfer of CCR9(-/-) or beta 7(-/-) T cells to wild-type mice partially inhibited OT. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of CCR9 and alpha 4 beta 7 on T cells and their subsequent localization to the gut is required for induction of OT in mice. Therapies designed to block gut-homing receptors might, under some conditions, interfere with normal tolerogenic mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa.

Recombinant allergens for allergen-specific immunotherapy: 10 years anniversary of immunotherapy with recombinant allergens	ALLERGY			English	Review						allergy; clinical trial; immunotherapy; recombinant allergen	BIRCH-POLLEN ALLERGEN; BET V 1; DUST MITE ALLERGEN; 3-YEAR DOUBLE-BLIND; B-CELL EPITOPES; PHL P 1; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-E; IGE ANTIBODIES; SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY; DIAGNOSTIC GATEKEEPERS	P>The broad applicability of allergen-specific immunotherapy for the treatment and eventually prevention of IgE-mediated allergy is limited by the poor quality and allergenic activity of natural allergen extracts that are used for the production of current allergy vaccines. Today, the genetic code of the most important allergens has been deciphered; recombinant allergens equalling their natural counterparts have been produced for diagnosis and immunotherapy, and a large panel of genetically modified allergens with reduced allergenic activity has been characterized to improve safety of immunotherapy and explore allergen-specific prevention strategies. Successful immunotherapy studies have been performed with recombinant allergens and hypoallergenic allergen derivatives and will lead to the registration of the first recombinant allergen-based vaccines in the near future. There is no doubt that recombinant allergen-based vaccination strategies will be generally applicable to most allergen sources, including respiratory, food and venom allergens and allow to produce safe allergy vaccines for the treatment of the most common forms of IgE-mediated allergies.

Allergy-related outcomes in relation to serum IgE: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Allergen; allergy; allergic sensitization; serum IgE	INHALANT ALLERGENS; NATURAL-HISTORY; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; DUST-MITE; SKIN-TEST; US HOMES; RHINITIS; PREVALENCE; ASTHMA	Background: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 was the first population-based study to investigate levels of serum total and allergen-specific IgE in the general US population. Objective: We estimated the prevalence of allergy-related outcomes and examined relationships between serum IgE levels and these outcomes in a representative sample of the US population. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional analysis were obtained from NHANES 2005-2006. Study subjects aged 6 years and older (n = 8086) had blood taken for measurement of total IgE and 19 specific IgE levels against common aeroallergens, including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Bermuda grass, birch, oak, ragweed, Russian thistle, rye grass, cat dander, cockroach, dog dander, dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), mouse and rat urine proteins, and selected foods (egg white, cow's milk, peanut, and shrimp). Serum samples were analyzed for total and allergen-specific IgE by using the Pharmacia CAP System. Information on allergy-related outcomes and demographics was collected by questionnaire. Results: In NHANES 2005-2006, 6.6% reported current hay fever, and 23.5% had current allergies. Allergy-related outcomes increased with increasing total IgE levels (adjusted odds ratios for a 10-fold increase in total IgE level of 1.86 [95% CI, 1.44-2.41] for hay fever and 1.64 [ 95% CI, 1.41-1.91] for allergies). Increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific IgE contributed independently to allergy-related symptoms. The greatest increase in odds was observed for hay fever and plant-specific IgE (adjusted odds ratio, 4.75; 95% CI, 3.83-5.88). Conclusion: In the US population self-reported allergy symptoms are most consistently associated with increased levels of plant-, pet-, and mold-specific IgE.

Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and rate of recovery for FPIES in a large-scale, population-based prospective study. Methods: In a prospective study the feeding history of 13,019 infants was obtained. Infants with probable adverse reactions to cow's milk protein (CMP) were clinically examined, skin prick tested, and challenged orally. Diagnostic criteria for CMP-induced FPIES included age less than 9 months, delayed recurrent vomiting (usually with nausea), and lethargy after exposure to CMP in the absence of other IgE-mediated symptoms, such as rash, urticaria, and respiratory symptoms. In addition, a positive challenge response to milk resulted in the above-mentioned gastrointestinal symptoms, removal of milk from the diet resulted in the resolution of those symptoms, or both. Results: Ninety-eight percent of the cohort participated in the study. The cumulative incidence for FPIES was 0.34% (44/13,019 patients). The most common symptoms were recurrent vomiting (100%), lethargy (77%) diarrhea (25%), pallor (14%), and bloody diarrhea (4.5%). All patients had FPIES within the first 6 months of life. By the age of 3 years, 90% of the patients had recovered. We did not detect any concomitant reaction to soy. Eight patients with FPIES had IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (IgE-CMA). Conclusions: The prevalence of FPIES is significant, and its clinical presentation is distinct from that of IgE-CMA. Most patients with FPIES recover, although a proportion might convert to IgE-CMA. The likelihood for a cross-reactivity to soy in this population was less than previously estimated. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:647-53.)

Antibiotic Exposure by 6 Months and Asthma and Allergy at 6 Years: Findings in a Cohort of 1,401 US Children	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						anti-bacterial agents; asthma; child; cohort studies; hypersensitivity	EARLY-CHILDHOOD; HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS; 1ST YEAR; MEDICATION USE; INCREASED RISK; BIRTH COHORT; SCHOOL-AGE; EARLY-LIFE; T-CELLS; INFECTIONS	Many studies have reported that antibiotic use may be associated with increased risk of childhood asthma. Respiratory tract infections in small children may be difficult to distinguish from early symptoms of asthma, and studies may have been confounded by "protopathic" bias, where antibiotics are used to treat early symptoms of asthma. These analyses of a cohort including 1,401 US children assess the association between antibiotic use within the first 6 months of life and asthma and allergy at 6 years of age between 2003 and 2007. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 2.16). The odds ratio if asthma was first diagnosed after 3 years of age was 1.66 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.79) and, in children with no history of lower respiratory infection in the first year of life, the odds ratio was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.12, 3.46). The adverse effect of antibiotics was particularly strong in children with no family history of asthma (odds ratio = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.58) (P(interaction) = 0.03). The odds ratio for a positive allergy blood or skin test was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.28). The results show that early antibiotic use was associated with asthma and allergy at 6 years of age, and that protopathic bias was unlikely to account for the main findings.

Allergic rhinitis is a common condition which can significantly impair quality of life. Immunotherapy by injection can significantly reduce symptoms and medication use but its use is limited by the possibility of severe systemic adverse reactions. Immunotherapy by the sublingual route is therefore of considerable interest. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis in adults and children. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 August 2009. Selection criteria Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of sublingual immunotherapy in adults or children. Primary outcome measures were symptom and medication scores. We also collected adverse event data. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors selected studies and assessed risk of bias. One author extracted data which was rechecked by two other authors. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a random-effects model to combine data. Main results We included a total of 60 randomised controlled trials in the review. Forty-nine were suitable for pooling in meta-analyses (2333 SLIT, 2256 placebo participants). Overall, we found a significant reduction in symptoms (SMD-0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.34, P < 0.00001) andmedication requirements (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.21, P < 0.00001) in participants receiving sublingual immunotherapy compared to placebo. None of the trials included in this review reported severe systemic reactions or anaphylaxis, and none of the systemic reactions reported required the use of adrenaline. Authors' conclusions This updated review reinforces the conclusion of the original 2003 Cochrane Review that sublingual immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinitis and has been proven to be a safe route of administration.

Analyses of associations with asthma in four asthma population samples from Canada and Australia	HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							TOBACCO-SMOKE EXPOSURE; ALLERGIC DISORDERS; PRIMARY PREVENTION; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; GENETIC-VARIANTS; LUNG-FUNCTION; ORMDL3 EXPRESSION; EARLY-LIFE; HIGH-RISK; IN-UTERO	Asthma, atopy, and related phenotypes are heterogeneous complex traits, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Extensive research has been conducted and over hundred genes have been associated with asthma and atopy phenotypes, but many of these findings have failed to replicate in subsequent studies. To separate true associations from false positives, candidate genes need to be examined in large well-characterized samples, using standardized designs (genotyping, phenotyping and analysis). In an attempt to replicate previous associations we amalgamated the power and resources of four studies and genotyped 5,565 individuals to conduct a genetic association study of 93 previously associated candidate genes for asthma and related phenotypes using the same set of 861 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a common genotyping platform, and relatively harmonized phenotypes. We tested for association between SNPs and the dichotomous outcomes of asthma, atopy, atopic asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness using a general allelic likelihood ratio test. No SNP in any gene reached significance levels that survived correction for all tested SNPs, phenotypes, and genes. Even after relaxing the usual stringent multiple testing corrections by performing a gene-based analysis (one gene at a time as if no other genes were typed) and by stratifying SNPs based on their prior evidence of association, no genes gave strong evidence of replication. There was weak evidence to implicate the following: IL13, IFNGR2, EDN1, and VDR in asthma; IL18, TBXA2R, IFNGR2, and VDR in atopy; TLR9, TBXA2R, VDR, NOD2, and STAT6 in airway hyperresponsiveness; TLR10, IFNGR2, STAT6, VDR, and NPSR1 in atopic asthma. Additionally we found an excess of SNPs with small effect sizes (OR < 1.4). The low rate of replication may be due to small effect size, differences in phenotypic definition, differential environmental effects, and/or genetic heterogeneity. To aid in future replication studies of asthma genes a comprehensive database was compiled and is available to the scientific community at http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca.

SCAALA	Early infection with Trichuris trichiura and allergen skin test reactivity in later childhood	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Article						allergen skin test reactivity; asthma; atopy; immune programming; intestinal helminths; rhinitis; Trichuris trichiura	SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; GEOHELMINTH INFECTIONS; GABONESE SCHOOLCHILDREN; HELMINTHIC INFECTION; HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS; ATOPY; PARASITES; ASTHMA; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE	Background Allergic diseases cause a large and increasing burden in developed countries and in urban centres in middle-income countries. The causes of this increase are unknown and, currently, there are no interventions to prevent the development of allergic diseases. The 'hygiene hypothesis' has tried to explain the increase through a reduction in the frequency of childhood infections causing a failure to program the immune system for adequate immune regulation. Intestinal helminth parasites are prevalent in childhood in developing countries and are associated with a lower prevalence of allergen skin test reactivity and asthma. Objectives To investigate whether children who had intestinal helminth infections during early childhood have a lower prevalence of allergen skin test reactivity later in childhood. Methods We re-visited a population of 1055 children from whom stool samples had been collected for detection of intestinal helminth infections for another study, and collected new stool samples and performed allergen skin prick testing. Information on potential confounding variables was collected. Results Children with heavy infections with Trichuris trichiura in early childhood had a significantly reduced prevalence of allergen skin test reactivity in later childhood, even in the absence of T. trichiura infection at the time of skin testing in later childhood. Conclusion Early heavy infections with T. trichiura may protect against the development of allergen skin test reactivity in later childhood. Novel treatments to program immune-regulation in early childhood in a way that mimics the effects of early infections with T. trichiura may offer new strategies for the prevention of allergic disease.

The ARIA workshop, held in December 1999, published a report in 2001 and new information has subsequently been published. The initial ARIA document lacked some important information on several issues. This document updates the ARIA sections on the pharmacologic and anti-IgE treatments of allergic rhinitis. Literature published between January 2000 and December 2004 has been included. Only a few studies assessing nasal and non-nasal symptoms are presented as these will be discussed in a separate document.

CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 EXPRESSION; DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY	Nitric oxide (NO center dot) is produced by many diverse cell types as a cellular or intracellular signaling molecule, by the activation of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). All three known NOS isoforms are expressed within the respiratory tract and mediate various air-way functional properties such as airway smooth muscle tone, ciliary function, epithelial electrolyte transport, and innate host defense. The respiratory epithelium is a major source of NO center dot in which it regulates normal epithelial cell function and signaling as well as signaling pathways involved in airway inflammation. In addition to its normal physiological properties, increased airway NO center dot production in inflammatory respiratory tract diseases such as asthma may activate additional signaling mechanisms to regulate inflammatory-immune pathways, and epithelial barrier (dys)function or repair. The biological actions of NO center dot are controlled at various levels, including mechanisms that regulate NOS localization and activation, and variable oxidative metabolism of NO center dot resulting in generation of bioactive reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Moreover, in addition to altered production of NO center dot or RNS, the presence of various target enzymes and/or metabolic regulators of NO center dot/RNS can be dramatically altered during airway inflammatory conditions, and contribute to alterations in W-mediated signaling pathways in disease. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding NO center dot-mediated epithelial signaling, as well as disease-related changes in airway NOS biology and target enzymes that affect NO center dot/RNS signaling mechanisms. A detailed understanding of these various changes and their impact on NO center dot signaling pathways are needed to fully appreciate the contributions of NO center dot/RNS to airway inflammation and to develop suitable therapeutic approaches based on regulating NO center dot function.

We investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of 4 licorice extracts: extracts of roasted licorice obtained by ethanol (rLE) or water extraction (rLW) and extracts of raw licorice obtained by ethanol (LE) or water extraction (LW). rLE demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory activity through its ability to reduce nitric oxide and prostaglandin E-2 production in the LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage cell, RAW264.7. It also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD14 expression on the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Further study indicated that LPS-induced degradation and phosphorylation of I kappa-B alpha, along with DNA-binding of NF-kappa B, was significantly inhibited by rLE exposure in RAW264.7 cells. In the murine model, we found that in vivo exposure to rLE-induced an increase in the survival rate, reduced plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased IL-10 production in LPS-treated mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the use of rLE may be a useful therapeutic approach to various inflammatory diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Some studies have indicated that OHE has considerable impact on quality of life (QoL) and may lead to depression. The aims of the study were to determine risk factors for low QoL, the frequency and severity of depression among OHE patients and changes in QoL and depression after 12 months of follow up. The study population, 758 patients, comprised all new recognized cases from the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries Registry between October 2001 and November 2002. All patients received a questionnaire to determine impairment of QoL and depressive symptoms. A similar follow-up questionnaire was posted after 1 year. The response rate was 82% at baseline and 91% at follow up. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index total score was 5.5 for all patients and 7.8 for severe OHE cases. Severe OHE cases and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with low QoL. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 9%. Only minor changes in QoL and depressive symptoms were found after 12 months of follow up.

Objective: To assess the safety of high-dose sublingual-swallow immunotherapy (SLIT) in a group of children younger than 5 years. Methods: Sixty-five children (51 boys and 14 girls; age range, 38-80 months; mean +/- SD age, 60 +/- 10 years; median age, 60 months) were included in this observational study. They were treated with SLIT with a build-up phase of 11 days, culminating in a top dose of 300 IR (index of reactivity) and a maintenance phase of 300 IR 3 times a week. The allergens used were house dust mites in 42 patients, grass pollen in 11 patients, olive pollen in 5 patients, Parietaria pollen in 4 patients, and cypress pollen in 3 patients. All adverse reactions and changes in the treatment schedule were compared in 2 subgroups: children 38 to 60 months old and children 61 to 80 months old. Results: The average cumulative dose of SLIT was 36,900 IR. Adverse reactions were observed in 11 children, none of them severe enough to require discontinuation of immunotherapy. Six reactions occurred in the 60 months or younger age group and 7 in the older than 60 months age group, with no differences between these 2 groups. Conclusion: High-dose immunotherapy in children younger than 5 years does not cause more adverse reactions than in children aged 5 to 7 years. There is no reason to forbear studies on safety and efficacy of these preparations in young children.

Objective: We sought to quantitate serum IgE and IgG antibodies to a panel of purified cockroach allergens among cockroach-sensitized subjects. Methods: IgE antibodies to recombinant cockroach allergens (rBla g 1, rBla g 2, rBla g 4, rBla g 5, and rPer a 7) were measured in sera containing IgE antibodies to Blattella germanica extract (n = 118) by using a streptavidin CAP assay and a multiplex flow cytometric assay. Specific IgG antibodies were determined by using radioimmuno-precipitation techniques. Results: Specific IgE antibodies measured by means of CAP assay and multiplex assay were strongly correlated (r = 0.8, P < .001). The sum of IgE antibodies (in international units per milliliter) against all 5 allergens equated to IgE antibodies to cockroach extract. Although the prevalence of IgE antibodies was highest for rBla g 2 (54.4%) and rBla g 5 (37.4%), patterns of IgE antibody binding were unique to each subject. Surprisingly, only 16% of cockroach-sensitized subjects with IgE antibodies to house dust mite exhibited IgE antibody binding to cockroach tropomyosin (rPer a 7). Specific IgE antibodies were associated with increased IgG antibody levels, although detection of IgG in the absence of IgE was not uncommon. Conclusion: The techniques described offer a new approach for defining the hierarchy of purified allergens. IgE antibodies directed against 5 allergens constitute the majority of the IgE antibody repertoire for cockroach. Such distinct, patterns of IgE-IgG responsiveness to different cockroach allergens highlight the complexity of B-cell responses to environmental allergens.

There is therefore concern about their use in patients who have a history of anaphylaxis or are on allergen immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is the best available treatment for prevention of life-threatening anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera stings, which is often observed in elderly patients who have cardiovascular disease and therefore are on beta-blocker treatment. Objective: To analyze the risk of beta-blocker treatment during venom immunotherapy. Methods: We screened all 1682 patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy seen during a period of 34 months for immunotherapy, cardiovascular disease, and treatment with beta-blockers. Results: Of the 1389 patients in whom immunotherapy was recommended, 11.2% had cardiovascular disease, and 44 of these were on beta-blockers before immunotherapy. In 31 of those, the drug was replaced before starting treatment. In 3 with coronary heart disease and I with severe ventricular arrhythmia, the drug was continued throughout immunotherapy. In 9, it was reintroduced after reaching the maintenance dose. In an additional 12 patients, beta-blockers were newly started during immunotherapy. Of 25 patients on beta-blockers during immunotherapy, 3 (12%) developed allergic side effects, compared with 23 (16.7%) of 117 with cardiovascular disease but without beta-blockers. Systemic allergic symptoms after re-exposure by sting challenge or field sting were observed in 1 of 7 (14.3%) with and 4 of 29 (13.8%) without beta-blockade. No severe reactions to treatment or sting reexposure were observed in patients with beta-blockade. Conclusion: Combination of beta-blockers with venom immunotherapy may be indicated in heavily exposed patients with severe cardiovascular disease.

The focus is on particulate matter as it has been shown to have large impact on human health. CAFE requested that WHO make a review of the latest findings on air pollutants and health to facilitate assessments of the different air pollutants and their health effects. The WHO review project on health aspects of air pollution in Europe confirmed that exposure to particulate matter (PM), despite the lower levels we face today, still poses a significant risk to human health. Using the recommended uniform risk coefficients for health impact assessment of PM, regardless of sources, premature mortality related to long-range transported anthropogenic particles has been estimated to be about 3500 deaths per year for the Swedish population, corresponding to a reduction in life expectancy of up to about seven months. The influence of local sources is more difficult to estimate due to large uncertainties when linking available risk coefficients to exposure data, but the estimates indicate about 1800 deaths brought forward each year with a life expectancy reduction of about 2-3 months. However, some sectors of the population are exposed to quite high locally induced concentrations and are likely to suffer excessive reductions in life expectancy. Since the literature increasingly supports assumptions that combustion related particles are associated with higher relative risks, further studies may shift the focus for abatement strategies. CAFE sets out to establish a general cost effective abatement strategy for atmospheric particles. Our results, based on studies of background exposure, show that long-range transported sulfate rich particles dominate the health effects of PM in Sweden. The same results would be found for the whole of Scandinavia and many countries influenced by transboundary air pollution. However, several health studies, including epidemiological studies with a finer spatial resolution, indicate that engine exhaust particles are more damaging to health than other particles. These contradictory findings must be understood and source specific risk estimates have to be established by expert bodies, otherwise it will not be possible to find the most cost effective abatement strategy for Europe. We are not happy with today's situation where every strategy to reduce PM concentrations is estimated to have the same impact per unit change in the mass concentration. Obviously there is a striking need to introduce more specific exposure variables and a higher geographical resolution in epidemiology as well as in health impact assessments.

However, this population includes Mexican Americans born in the United States and in Mexico, and risk factors that might impact the prevalence of asthma differ between these groups. To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for asthma among U.S.- and Mexican-born Mexican Americans, we analyzed data from two U.S. surveys that included 4,574 persons who self-reported their ethnicity as Mexican American from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 1998-1994 and 12,980 persons who self-reported their ethnicity as Mexican American from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 1997-2001. U.S.-born Mexican Americans were more likely than Mexican-born Mexican Americans to report ever having asthma in both the NHANES III (7% [SE 0.5] vs. 3% [SE 0.3], p < 0.001) and NHIS surveys (8.1% [0.4] vs. 2.5% [0.2], p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression model controlling for multiple demographic variables and health care, the risk for asthma was higher among U.S.-born Mexicans in NHANES III (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.3) and NHIS (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.6-5.5). In conclusion, the prevalence of asthma was higher in U.S.-born than in Mexican-born Mexican Americans. This finding highlights the importance of environmental exposures in developing asthma in a migratory population.

The goal of the study was to carry out a prospective and multi-centric trial to evaluate the safety, risk factors and compliance degree of commercially available SIT. Materials and methods The study was carried out in 14 allergy departments from Spain. Four-hundred and eighty-eight patients with rhinitis and/or asthma were submitted to treatment with biologically standardized allergen extracts commercially available. They were administered following the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines. Results Four hundred and twenty-three patients (86.7%) completed the treatment and remained under control at the end of the trial. Out of 17 526 administered doses, 17 368 doses (99.1%) were not associated with a reaction. Eighteen patients (3.7%) experienced 53 (0.3% of the doses) SRs. All immediate SRs were mild or moderate and responded well to ordinary treatment measures. There were no fatal reactions, anaphylactic shock or life-threatening reactions. A higher ratio of SRs was found among asthmatic and dust mite allergic patients, although multi-variable logistic analysis did not demonstrate any risk factor associated with SRs. There was also a subgroup of patients at risk for recurrent reactions, and therefore 40% of SRs had been avoided if the maximal number of SRs had been previously limited to only three SRs. Conclusions This multi-centric study showed that SIT was a safe treatment with a very good compliance. Future guidelines of SIT should limit the maximal number of SRs.

A wide range of immunological, endocrinological, and neuronal pathways are known to mediate and modulate a systemic stress response. Interestingly, most of these mediators play a crucial role in initiating and perpetuating symptoms associated with bronchial asthma. To explore potential mechanisms linking stress to asthma exacerbation we developed an animal model that combines allergic airway inflammation and exposure to stress. Methods: CBA/J mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) and challenged with OVA aerosol via the airways. Additionally, some mice were stressed by exposure to an ultrasonic stressor. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured in vitro by electric field stimulation (EFS) of tracheal smooth muscle elements. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was obtained and cell numbers determined. Cytokine levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma in BAL were determined by ELISA. Results: Our findings demonstrate that exogenously applied stress dramatically enhances airway reactivity in OVA-sensitized and challenged mice. Further, stress significantly increases allergen-induced airway inflammation identified by increased leukocyte (ie, eosinophil) numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Conclusions: We found further evidence that stress can indeed exacerbate airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation in an animal model of allergic bronchial asthma and now introduce a novel murine model to identify stress-triggered pathways, including mediators as neurohormones, neuropeptides, and markers of inflammation.

Objective To study the effect of early endotoxin exposure on incidence of atopic sensitization, atopic dermatitis and wheezing until the age of 2 years in infants with different risk status in terms of parental atopy. Methods Data of 1942 infants of an ongoing birth cohort study were analysed by logistic regression. Endotoxin was measured in settled dust of the mothers' mattresses at infants' age of 3 months. Data on allergic symptoms and physicians' diagnoses were gathered by questionnaire. Sensitization to common food and inhalant allergens was assessed by specific serum IgE. Results High endotoxin levels increased the risk of repeated wheeze [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for 4th exposure quartile ((Q4)) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.14], but were associated with neither sensitization to food allergens nor atopic dermatitis. Stratification by parental atopy showed that there was an association of endotoxin exposure with incidence of repeated wheeze as well as with sensitization to inhalant allergens (P for trend = 0.008 and 0.044, respectively) only in infants with parental atopy, with the highest risk in the 4th exposure quartile (repeated wheeze: ORQ4 1.77, 95% CI 1.14-2.73; sensitization to inhalant allergens: ORQ4 1.69, 95% CI 0.70-4.11). Conclusion Early endotoxin exposure in terms of mattress dust endotoxin levels seemed to increase the risk of atopic reactions to inhalant allergens at the age of 2 years, especially in infants at risk due to parental atopy. Our data disagree with an early protective effect of endotoxin on atopy development until the age of 2 years.

Physiologically, bronchial hyperresponsiveness is documented by decreased bronchial airflow after bronchoprovocation with methacholine or histamine. Other triggers that provoke airway obstruction include cold air, exercise, viral upper respiratory infection, cigarette smoke, and respiratory allergens. Bronchial provocation with allergen induces a prompt early phase immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated decrease in bronchial airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) followed in many patients by a late-phase IgE-mediated reaction with a decrease in bronchial airflow for 4-8 hours. The gross pathology of asthmatic airways displays lung hyperinflation, smooth muscle hypertrophy, lamina reticularis thickening, mucosal edema, epithelial cell sloughing, cilia cell disruption, and mucus gland hypersecretion. Microscopically, asthma is characterized by the presence of increased numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells in the bronchial tissues, bronchial secretions, and mucus. Initially, there is recruitment of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the airway by activated CD, T-lymphocytes. The activated T-lymphocytes also direct the release of inflammatory mediators from eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. In addition, the subclass 2 helper T-lymphocytes subset of activated T-lymphocytes produces interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 in conjunction with IL-13 signals the switch from IgM to IgE antibodies. The cross-linkage of two IgE molecules by allergen causes mast cells to degranulate, releasing histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators that perpetuate the airway inflammation. IL-5 activates the recruitment and activation of eosinophils. The activated mast cells and eosinophils also generate their cytokines that help to perpetuate the inflammation. Regardless of the triggers of asthma, the repeated cycles of inflammation in the lungs with injury to the pulmonary tissues followed by repair may produce long-term structural changes ("remodeling") of the airways. This review will discuss in greater detail the relationships of inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness to the pathophysiology of asthma.

This study compares detailed nasal challenge results obtained from patients with idiopathic rhinitis to those of atopic and normal controls. Methods Patients with idiopathic rhinitis (n = 23), perennial allergic rhinitis (n = 8) and normal controls (n = 8) underwent a normal saline challenge to exclude hyper-reactivity and then bilateral nasal allergen challenges. Nasal patency was assessed by anterior active rhinomanometry. Results All of the patients with atopic rhinitis demonstrated positive bilateral allergen challenges. All normal control subjects had bilateral negative challenges. Two patients in the idiopathic group tested positively to saline and were excluded from further study with 62% of the remainder testing positive to allergens. Of the idiopathic patients testing positive, 85% were sensitive to house dust mite. Conclusion A significant proportion of patients with idiopathic rhinitis have positive nasal challenges, the vast majority to house dust mite allergen. These findings add to the weight of evidence that suggests 'localized allergy' may exist in the absence of systemic atopic markers.

We also examined to what extent the association of gender, age, and smoking to the incidence of respiratory symptoms and asthma differed if the analyses were based on the 65% (n = 2,079) initial responders, or were based on the 89% (n = 2,819) who responded after three reminders. The associations between the six symptoms/asthma and the gender, age, and smoking groups amounted to 42 odds ratios. The adjusted odds ratio for responding at follow-up was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.90) for those being middle aged at baseline compared to younger subjects. The adjusted odds ratios for responding at follow-up for those being students, unemployed, or retired at baseline were 0.50 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.73), 0.29 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.55), 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.36), respectively, compared to being employed. Of the 42 odds ratios mentioned above, 25 differed less than 10% when comparing the initial and all respondents. Twelve differed 10-20% and five differed 20-45%. The study indicates that to ensure a high participation rate in a follow-up study one should pay special attention to those being late responders, unemployed, retired, or students at baseline. No overt differences were observed in the gender, age, and, smoking associations to the respiratory disorders when the analyses were based on the initial compared to all respondents.

Exposure to indoor asthma triggers plays an important role in the development and exacerbation of asthma. We describe the implementation of the Seattle-King County Healthy Homes Project, a randomized, controlled trial of an outreach/education intervention to improve asthma-related health status by reducing exposure to allergens and irritants in the home. We randomly assigned 274 low-income children with asthma ages 4-12 to either a high- or a low-intensity group. In the high-intensity group, community health workers called Community Home Environmental Specialists (CHES) conducted initial home environmental assessments, provided individualized action plans, and made additional visits over a 12-month period to provide education and social support, encouragement of participant actions, provision of materials to reduce exposures (including bedding encasements), assistance with roach and rodent eradication, and advocacy for improved housing conditions. Members of the low-intensity group received the initial assessment, home action plan, limited education during the assessment visit, and bedding encasements. We describe the recruitment and training of CHES and challenges they faced and explain the assessment and exposure reduction protocols addressing dust mites, mold, tobacco smoke, Pets, cockroaches, rodents, dust, moisture, and toxic or hazardous chemicals. We also discuss the gap between the practices recommended in the literature and what is feasible in the home. We accomplished home interventions and participants found the project very useful. The project was limited in resolving structural housing quality issues that contributed to exposure to indoor triggers.

OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence of asthma diagnosis and self-reported allergy in schoolchildren in relation to the school environment. DESIGN: Data on asthma and allergies were collected through a postal questionnaire answered in 1993 and 1997 by 1347 (78%) pupils (initially aged 7-13 years) in 39 randomly chosen schools. Indoor pollutants were measured in about 100 classrooms in 1993 and 1995. Relationships between indoor pollutants and incidence of asthma diagnosis and self-reported allergy were studied by multiple logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, atopy and smoking. RESULTS: The incidence of asthma diagnosis was higher in pupils attending schools with more settled dust and more cat allergen (Fel d 1) in this dust. Incidence of self-reported furry pet allergy was higher in schools with more respirable particles. Among children without a history of atopy, a new asthma diagnosis was more common at higher concentrations of formaldehyde and total moulds in the classroom air.

The debate has centred around standards against which to validate asthma measurements but the absence of a "gold standard" makes the criterion validation of measurements difficult. Questionnaires will always be useful but cannot be validated against a doctor diagnosis because of self-selection and recall biases. In practice, measurements should be selected on the merits of what they measure rather than being regarded as validated or non-validated alternatives. The measurement of AHR is invaluable because it is reliable, not influenced by variations in symptom perception or diagnostic trends, and is closely related to the underlying mechanisms of asthma. The value of AHR lies in its high specificity (rate of true negatives) and low sensitivity (rate of false positives) against asthma symptoms which gives additional information about symptomatic subjects. Atopy is also a useful test and, in quantifying its association with asthma, we should not place any currency on ecological evidence. Atopy is a strong risk factor for asthma in the presence of regionally specific allergens and ecological analyses that ignore these effects are diversionary rather than productive. For preventing asthma, we need to identify the group at greatest risk of developing it, measure the risk factors with precision, and develop interventions that are effective in changing environmental exposures and homogenous outcomes. This is the only approach that has the potential to lead to significant public health benefits.

Pollen-sensitive athletes may encounter problems with allergic symptoms triggered by pollen exposure, thus compromising their ability to attain peak performance. Objective: We sought to monitor pollen levels at the major Olympic venues to provide information for allergic athletes and their team doctors in order to adequately prepare them for Olympic competition. Methods: We performed aerobiologic monitoring of the major Olympic venues to provide a profile of the most prevalent pollen species appearing during the spring. In the second part of this study, we surveyed a population of elite Australian athletes from Olympic sports to ascertain the prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, to investigate the major allergens involved in sensitization, and to conduct a pilot study to assess the effect of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on quality of life. Results: The pollen counts obtained at the 3 major sites were high over the period of Olympic competition. Tree pollens appeared from July, and grasses appeared from early September and peaked in the second week of October, the beginning of Paralympic competition. A relatively small number of pollen varieties comprise the majority of the total pollen count. Two hundred fourteen athletes (61% male; mean age, 21 +/- 16 years) representing 12 Olympic sports participated in the study. Fifty-six percent gave a symptom history consistent with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, 41% had symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and a positive test response to any one allergen, and 29% had seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (a positive history and at least one positive skin prick test response to a seasonal allergen). Athletes from aquatic sports were more likely to have symptoms than those from other sports, Symptom scores were higher and quality of life ratings were poorer in allergic compared with nonallergic athletes over the spring period, Conclusion: Olympic team managers and medical officers need to adequately prepare Olympic athletes for the possibility of exposure to high pollen levels in the weeks leading up to this most important sporting event. Symptoms of pollen sensitivity, such as rhinoconjunctivitis and exacerbation of asthma, could be devastating to athletes expecting peak performance, Potential Olympic athletes should be screened for the possibility of pollen allergy and have medical programs with permitted medication tailored to meet their needs. This may involve preventative therapy with meditation, such as intranasal corticosteroid sprays or immunotherapy programs, if symptoms are particularly severe. The newer nonsedating antihistamines are the treatment of choice fur acute intermittent symptoms, Appropriate management will ensure that the allergic athlete will safely perform to maximum ability with permitted medication during the Spring 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.

Of particular interest are the single extracellular CTLD-containing receptors of the 'Dectin-1' and 'Dectin-2' clusters, which associate with signalling adaptors or possess integral intracellular signalling domains. These CLRs have traditionally been associated with the recognition of fungi, but recent discoveries have revealed diverse and unexpected functions. In this review, we describe their newly identified roles in anti-microbial host defence, homeostasis, autoimmunity, allergy and their functions in the recognition and response to dead and cancerous cells.

Objective: We sought to determine total hospital days, antibiotic exposures, and the prevalence rates of Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in patients with and without penicillin "allergy" at hospital admission. Methods: We performed a retrospective, matched cohort study of subjects admitted to Kaiser Foundation hospitals in Southern California during 2010 through 2012. Results: It was possible to match 51,582 (99.6% of all possible cases) unique hospitalized subjects with penicillin "allergy" to 2 unique discharge diagnosis category-matched, sex-matched, age-matched, and date of admission-matched control subjects each. Cases with penicillin "allergy" averaged 0.59 (9.9%; 95% CI, 0.47-0.71) more total hospital days during 20.1 +/- 10.5 months of follow-up compared with control subjects. Cases were treated with significantly more fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and vancomycin (P < .0001) for each antibiotic compared with control subjects. Cases had 23.4% (95% CI, 15.6% to 31.7%) more C difficile, 14.1% (95% CI, 7.1% to 21.6%) more MRSA, and 30.1% (95% CI, 12.5% to 50.4%) more VRE infections than expected compared with control subjects. Conclusions: A penicillin "allergy" history, although often inaccurate, is not a benign finding at hospital admission. Subjects with a penicillin "allergy" history spend significantly more time in the hospital. Subjects with a penicillin "allergy" history are exposed to significantly more antibiotics previously associated with C difficile and VRE. Drug "allergies" in general, but most those notably to penicillin, are associated with increased hospital use and increased C difficile, MRSA, and VRE prevalence.

Objective: Our hypothesis was that specific mold exposures are associated with childhood asthma development. Methods: Infants were identified from birth certificates. Dust samples were collected from 289 homes when the infants were 8 months of age. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of 36 molds that comprise the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) and endotoxin, house dust mite, cat, dog, and cockroach allergens. Children were evaluated at age 7 years for asthma based on reported symptoms and objective measures of lung function. Host, environmental exposure, and home characteristics evaluated included a history of parental asthma, race, sex, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, season of birth, family income, cigarette smoke exposure, air conditioning, use of a dehumidifier, presence of carpeting, age of home, and visible mold at age 1 year and child's positive skin prick test response to aeroallergens and molds at age 7 years. Results: Asthma was diagnosed in 24% of the children at age 7 years. A statistically significant increase in asthma risk at age 7 years was associated with high ERMI values in the child's home in infancy (adjusted relative risk for a 10-unit increase in ERMI value, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2). The summation of levels of 3 mold species, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus unguis, and Penicillium variabile, was significantly associated with asthma (adjusted relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.7). Conclusion: In this birth cohort study exposure during infancy to 3 mold species common to water-damaged buildings was associated with childhood asthma at age 7 years.

Intrinsic Phenotypic Differences of Asthmatic Epithelium and Its Inflammatory Responses to Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Air Pollution	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						airway epithelium; asthma; inflammation and repair; RSV; particulate matter	EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASES; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; BRONCHIAL EPITHELIUM; CYTOKINE PRODUCTION; FACTOR RECEPTOR; ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES; DYSREGULATED REPAIR; SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; MAPK ACTIVATION	A substantial proportion of healthcare cost associated with asthma is attributable to exacerbations of the disease. Within the airway, the epithelium forms the mucosal immune barrier, the first structural cell defense against common environmental insults such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and particulate matter. We sought to characterize the phenotype of differentiated asthmatic-derived airway epithelial cultures and their intrinsic inflammatory responses to environmental challenges. Air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures were generated from asthmatic (n = 6) and nonasthmatic (n = 6) airway epithelial cells. Airway tissue and ALI cultures were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-5, E-cadherin, Ki67, Muc5AC, NF-kappa B, the activation of p38, and apoptosis. ALI cultures were exposed to RSV (4 x 10(6) plaque forming unit/ml), particulate matter collected by Environmental Health Canada (EHC-93, 100 mu g/ml), or mechanically wounded for 24, 48, and 96 hours and basolateral supernatants analyzed for inflammatory cytokines, using Luminex and ELISA. The airway epithelium in airway sections of patients with asthma as well as in vitro ALI cultures demonstrated a less differentiated epithelium, characterized by elevated numbers of basal cells marked by the expression of cytokeratin-5, increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and less adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Transepithelial resistance was not different between asthmatic and nonasthmatic cultures. In response to infection with RSV, exposure to EHC-93, or mechanical wounding, asthmatic ALI cultures released greater concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, compared with nonasthmatic cultures (P < 0.05). This parallel ex vivo and in vitro study of the asthmatic epithelium demonstrates an intrinsically altered phenotype and aberrant inflammatory response to common environmental challenges, compared with nonasthmatic epithelium.

Because of the difficulty and expense of undertaking human trials or even animal experiments, much of the current research uses in vitro models that simulate various aspects of digestion. The results of this research indicate that the rate and extent of protein digestion is governed by accessibility of the cleavage sites to enzymes and local flexibility of the substrate molecule. However, results have also shown that digestion of an allergenic protein to small fragments does not necessarily mean that it will no longer be immunologically active. Other factors are also important. For example, adsorption to an interface increased rates of digestion as did the presence of bile acids. In fact, interaction with a range of physiological surfactants has been shown to be extremely important in protein digestion. When protein is adsorbed to an emulsified food it can be displaced by the surfactants in either the stomach or the small intestine. Lipid interaction with the protein in solution has been demonstrated to be important in effecting rates of proteolysis and phospholipids in particular have provided a protective effect for some milk proteins. Conversely the presence of specific proteins has been shown to affect rates of lipid digestion. The number of such colloidal interactions that we now know may play a role in protein digestion highlights the importance of this area to understanding how we can produce food that optimises nutrition for the consumer.

First published October 29, 2009; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00749.2009.-Epidemiological data indicate that obesity is a risk factor for asthma, but the mechanistic basis for this relationship is not established. Here we review data from human subjects and animal models investigating the relationship between obesity and airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma. We discuss obesity as a state of chronic systemic inflammation resulting from interactions between adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages that are recruited to obese adipose tissue. Finally, we focus on the possibility that aspects of this inflammation, particularly obesity-related changes in TNF-alpha, leptin, and adiponectin, may contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness in obesity. Determining how obesity promotes asthma may uncover novel therapeutic strategies that are effective in the obese asthmatic subject.

The spatial relationship between traffic-generated air pollution and noise in 2 US cities	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Air pollution; Noise; Traffic; Confounding; Cardiovascular	AMBIENT NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; MAJOR HIGHWAY; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; HEART-DISEASE; LOS-ANGELES; EXPOSURE; ASTHMA; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION	Traffic-gene rated air pollution and noise have both been linked to cardiovascular morbidity. Since traffic is a shared source, there is potential for correlated exposures that may lead to confounding in epidemiologic studies. As part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air), 2-week NO and NO(2) concentrations were measured at up to 105 locations, selected primarily to characterize gradients near major roads, in each of 9 US communities. We measured 5-min A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels (L(eq)) and ultrafine particle (UFP) counts at a subset of these NO/NO(2) monitoring locations in Chicago, IL (N = 69 in December 2006; N = 36 in April 2007) and Riverside County, CA (N = 46 in April 2007). L(eq) and UFP were measured during non-"rush hour" periods (10:00-16:00) to maximize comparability between measurements. We evaluated roadway proximity exposure surrogates in relation to the measured levels, estimated noise-air pollution correlation coefficients, and evaluated the impact of regional-scale pollution gradients, wind direction, and roadway proximity on the correlations. Five-minute L(eq) measurements in December 2006 and April 2007 were highly correlated (r = 0.84), and measurements made at different times of day were similar (coefficients of variation: 0.5-13%), indicating that 5-min measurements are representative of long-term L(eq), Binary and continuous roadway proximity metrics characterized L(eq) as well or better than NO or NO(2). We found strong regional-scale gradients in NO and NO(2), particularly in Chicago, but only weak regional-scale gradients in L(eq) and UFP. L(eq) was most consistently correlated with NO, but the correlations were moderate (0.20-0.60). After removing the influence of regional-scale gradients the correlations generally increased (L(eq)-NO: r = 0.49-0.62), and correlations downwind of major roads (L(eq)-NO: r = 0.53-0.74) were consistently higher than those upwind (0.35-0.65). There was not a consistent effect of roadway proximity on the correlations. In conclusion, roadway proximity variables are not unique exposure surrogates in studies of endpoints hypothesized to be related to both air pollution and noise. Moderate correlations between traffic-generated air pollution and noise suggest the possibility of confounding, which might be minimized by considering regional pollution gradients and/or prevailing wind direction(s) in epidemiologic studies.

Objective: To describe the number and type of drugs used and to evaluate the role of different factors associated with PP (i.e. 6-9 drugs) and EPP (i.e. >= 10 drugs), with special reference to the number and type of medical diagnoses and symptoms, in a population of home-dwelling elderly persons aged >= 75 years. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort in 1998. The population consisted of home-dwelling elderly persons aged >= 75 years in the city of Kuopio, Finland. The data for the analysis were obtained from the Kuopio 75+ Study, which drew a random sample of 700 elderly residents aged >= 75 years living in the city of Kuopio from the population register. Of these, 601 attended a structured clinical examination and an interview carried out by a geriatrician and a trained nurse in 1998. For this analysis, all home-dwelling elderly participants (n=523) were included. Study data were expressed as proportions and means with standard deviations. The factors associated with PP and EPP were examined by multinomial logistic regression. Results: The most commonly used drugs were cardiovascular drugs (97% in EPP, 94% in PP and 59% in non-PP group) and analgesics (89%, 76% and 54%), respectively. Use of psychotropics was markedly higher in the EPP group (77%) than in the PP (42%) and non-PP groups (20%). The mean number of drugs per diagnosis was 3.6 in the EPP group, 2.6 in the PP group and 1.6 in the non-PP group. Factors associated only with EPP were moderate self-reported health (odds ratio [OR] 2.05; 95% CI 1.08, 3.89), female gender (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.27, 4.65) and age >= 85 years (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.41, 5.72). Factors that were associated with both PP and EPP included poor self-reported health (PP: OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.01, 4.59 and EPP: OR 6.02; 95% CI 2.55, 14.20), diabetes mellitus (PP: OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.26, 4.15 and EPP: OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.03, 4.18), depression (PP: OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.16, 3.90 and EPP: OR 2.93; 95% CI 1.51, 5.66), pain (PP: OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.68, 4.30 and EPP: OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.56, 4.82), heart disease (PP: OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.54, 4.08 and EPP: OR 4.63; 95% CI 2.45, 8.74) and obstructive pulmonary disease (including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [PP: OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.24, 6.25 and EPP: OR 6.82; 95% CI 2.87, 16.20]. Conclusions: The study indicates that the factors associated with PP and EPP are not uniform. Age >= 85 years, female gender and moderate self-reported health were factors associated only with EPP, while poor self-reported health and several specific disease states were associated with both PP and EPP. The high number of drugs per diagnosis observed in this study calls for a thorough assessment of the need for and outcomes associated with use of these drugs.

Asthma Is Inversely Associated with Helicobacter pylori Status in an Urban Population	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background: Microbial exposures have been suggested to confer protection from allergic disorders and reduced exposures to gastrointestinal microbiota have been proposed as an explanation for the increase in asthma prevalence. Since the general prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has been decreasing, we hypothesized that H. pylori serostatus would be inversely related to the presence of asthma. Methods: Adults were recruited to participate in the New York University (NYU)/Bellevue Asthma Registry in New York City. Adult asthma cases (N = 318) and controls (N = 208) were identified and serum IgG antibodies to H. pylori whole cell antigens or the immunodominant CagA antigen were measured. Results: As expected, the asthma cases and controls differed with respect to atopy and lung function. Seropositivity to H. pylori or CagA antigen was present in 47.1% of the total case and control study population. Asthma was inversely associated with CagA seropositivity (=OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36-0.89). Median age of onset of asthma (doctor's diagnosis) was older ( 21 years) among individuals with CagA+ strains than among H. pylori-individuals (11 years) (p = 0.006). Conclusion: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that colonization with CagA+ H. pylori strains is inversely associated with asthma and is associated with an older age of asthma onset in an urban population. The data suggest H. pylori as a marker for protection.

Disruption of the transcription factor Nrf2 promotes pro-oxidative dendritic cells that stimulate Th2-like immunoresponsiveness upon activation by ambient particulate matter	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							HEME OXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION; EXHAUST PARTICLE CHEMICALS; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; IN-VIVO; T-CELLS; ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION; COSTIMULATORY MOLECULES; ENHANCES SUSCEPTIBILITY; GLUTATHIONE DEPLETION; CYTOKINE PRODUCTION	Oxidative stress is important in dendritic cell (DC) activation. Environmental particulate matter (PM) directs pro-oxidant activities that may alter DC function. Nuclear erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that regulates expression of antioxidant and detoxification genes. Oxidative stress and defective antioxidant responses may contribute to the exacerbations of asthma. We hypothesized that PM would impart differential responses by Nrf2 wild-type DCs as compared with Nrf2(-/-) DCs. We found that the deletion of Nrf2 affected important constitutive functions of both bone marrow-derived and highly purified myeloid lung DCs such as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and their ability to take up exogenous Ag. Stimulation of Nrf2(-/-) DCs with PM augmented oxidative stress and cytokine production as compared with resting or Nrf2(+/+) DCs. This was associated with the enhanced induction of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. In contrast to Nrf2(+/+) DCs, coincubation of Nrf2(-/-) DCs with PM and the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine attenuated PM-induced up-regulation of CD80 and CD86. Our studies indicate a previously underappreciated role of Nrf2 in innate immunity and suggest that deficiency in Nrf2-dependent pathways may be involved in susceptibility to the adverse health effects of air pollution in part by promoting Th2 cytokine responses in the absence of functional Nrf2. Moreover, our studies have uncovered a hierarchal response to oxidative stress in terms of costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion in DCs and suggest an important role of heightened oxidative stress in proallergic Th2-mediated immune responses orchestrated by DCs.

Objective: We evaluated the use of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) malondialdehyde as a biomarker of exposure to traffic-related pollution in children with asthma as part of a panel study in Mexico City. Methods: Standard spirometry and collection of EBC and nasal lavage were performed. Environmental monitoring sites were located within 5 km of the children's homes and schools. Data were analyzed by using generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 480 samples of malondialdehyde were obtained from 107 patients with asthma, with a median level of 18.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 12.4-28.7) nmol. Ambient particulates less than 2.5 mu g/m(3) and ozone levels on the day of sampling were significantly associated with higher malondialdehyde levels. A 14.2-mu g/m(3) (IQR) increase in 8-hour moving average particulates less than 2.5 mu g/m(3) in size was associated with a 1.12-nmol increase in malondialdehyde and 4 15.9-ppb (IQR) increase in 8-hour moving average ozone with a 1.16-nmol increase in malondialdehyde. Malondialdehyde levels were inversely associated with forced vital capacity and FEV(1) and positively associated with IL-8 levels in nasal lavage. Conclusion: Exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde was related to both air pollution exposure and changes in lung function and inflammatory markers.

We could detect Bet v I-specific T cells in the PBMC of 20 birch pollen allergic patients, but also in 9 of 9 healthy individuals tested. Analysis at a single-cell level revealed that allergen-specific CD4(+) T cells from healthy individuals secrete IFN-gamma and IL-10 in response to the allergen, whereas cells from allergic patients are bona fide Th2 cells (producing mostly IL-5, some IL-10, but no IFN-gamma), as corroborated by patterns of cytokines produced by T cell clones. A fraction of Bet v 1-specific cells isolated from healthy, but not allergic, individuals also expresses CTLA-4, glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor, and Foxp 3, indicating that they represent regulatory T cells. In this model of seasonal exposure to allergen, we also demonstrate the tremendous dynamics of T cell responses in both allergic and nonallergic individuals during the peak pollen season, with an expansion of Bet v 1-specific precursors from 10(-6) to 10(-3) among circulating CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Allergy vaccines should be designed to recapitulate such naturally protective Th1/regulatory T cell responses observed in healthy individuals.

The industrial development and increased traffic may affect the indoor exposure to air pollutants in school environment. Moreover, there is a need to study respiratory effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and emissions from new building materials in homes in China. OBJECTIVES: We studied the associations between pupils' asthmatic symptoms and indoor and Outdoor air pollution in schools, as well as selected home exposures, in a coal-burning city in north China. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was administered to pupils (11-15 years of age) in 10 schools in urban Taiyuan, collecting data on respiratory health and selected home environmental factors. Indoor and outdoor school air pollutants and climate factors were measured in winter. RESULTS: A total of 1,993 pupils (90.2%) participated; 1.8% had cumulative asthma, 8.4% wheezing, 29.8% had daytime attacks of breathlessness, The indoor average concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and formaldehyde by class were 264.8, 39.4, 10.1, and 2.3 mu g/m(3), respectively. Outdoor levels were two to three times higher. Controlling for possible confounders, either wheeze or daytime or nocturnal attacks of breathlessness were positively associated with SO2, NO2, or formaldehyde. In addition, ETS and new furniture at home were risk factors for wheeze, daytime breathlessness, and respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: Indoor chemical air pollutants of mainly outdoor origin could be risk factors for pupils' respiratory symptoms at school, and home exposure to ETS and chemical emissions from new furniture could affect pupils' respiratory health.

Obesity and asthma: lessons from animal models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						mice; leptin; adiponectin; tumor necrosis factor-alpha; interleukin-6; adipokines	BODY-MASS INDEX; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; INTERLEUKIN-6 RECEPTOR GENE; INDUCED AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; INDUCED LUNG INFLAMMATION; APPARENTLY HEALTHY-MEN; EMERGENCY-ROOM VISITS; ACUTE-PHASE REACTANTS; ACUTE OZONE EXPOSURE; DIET-INDUCED OBESITY	Epidemiological data indicate that obesity is a risk factor for asthma. These data are supported by observations in several murine models of obesity. Ob/ob, db/db, and Cpe(fat) mice each exhibit innate airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma. These mice also respond more vigorously to common asthma triggers, including ozone. Here we discuss the implications of these data with respect to several mechanisms proposed to explain the relationship between obesity and asthma: 1) common etiologies; 2) comorbidities; 3) mechanical factors; and 4) adipokines. We focus on the role of adipokines, especially TNF-alpha, IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin. Understanding the mechanistic basis for the relationship between obesity and asthma may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of the obese asthmatic subject.

Exposure of neonates to Respiratory Syncytial Virus is critical in determining subsequent airway response in adults	RESPIRATORY RESEARCH			English	Article							BRONCHIOLITIS; INFECTION; INFANCY; DISEASE; ALLERGY; ASTHMA; AGE; HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; INFLAMMATION; ENHANCEMENT	Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis in infants and the elderly. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that RSV infection during infancy is a potent trigger of subsequent wheeze and asthma development. However, the mechanism by which RSV contributes to asthma is complex and remains largely unknown. A recent study indicates that the age of initial RSV infection is a key factor in determining airway response to RSV rechallenge. We hypothesized that severe RSV infection during neonatal development significantly alters lung structure and the pulmonary immune micro-environment; and thus, neonatal RSV infection is crucial in the development of or predisposition to allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Methods: To investigate this hypothesis the present study was conducted in a neonatal mouse model of RSV-induced pulmonary inflammation and airway dysfunction. Seven-day-old mice were infected with RSV (2 x 10(5) TCID50/g body weight) and allowed to mature to adulthood. To determine if neonatal RSV infection predisposed adult animals to enhanced pathophysiological responses to allergens, these mice were then sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Various endpoints including lung function, histopathology, cytokine production, and cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage were examined. Results: RSV infection in neonates alone led to inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway hyperreactivity, peribronchial and perivascular inflammation, and subepithelial fibrosis in adults. If early RSV infection was followed by allergen exposure, this pulmonary phenotype was exacerbated. The initial response to neonatal RSV infection resulted in increased TNF-alpha levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. Interestingly, increased levels of IL-13 and mucus hyperproduction were observed almost three months after the initial infection with RSV. Conclusion: Neonatal RSV exposure results in long term pulmonary inflammation and exacerbates allergic airways disease. The early increase in TNF-alpha in the bronchoalveolar lavage implicates this inflammatory cytokine in orchestrating these events. Finally, the data presented emphasize IL-13 and TNF-alpha as potential therapeutic targets for treating RSV induced-asthma.

These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire's disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire's disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (similar to 15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to beta-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance.

We studied a cohort of rural Iowa children to determine the association between farm.and other environmental risk factors with four asthma outcomes: doctor-diagnosed asthma, doctor-diagnosed asthma/medication for wheeze, current wheeze, and cough with exercise. Doctor-diagnosed asthma prevalence was 12%, but at least one of these four health outcomes was found in more than a third of the cohort. Multivariable models of the four health outcomes found independent associations between male sex (three asthma outcomes), age (three asthma outcomes), a personal history of allergies (four asthma outcomes), family history of allergic disease (two asthma outcomes), premature birth (one asthma outcome), early respiratory infection (three asthma outcomes), high-risk birth (two asthma outcomes), and farm exposure to raising swine and adding antibiotics to feed (two asthma outcomes). The high prevalence of rural childhood asthma and asthma symptoms underscores the need for asthma screening programs and improved asthma diagnosis and treatment. The high prevalence of asthma health outcomes among farm children living on farms that raise swine (44.1 %, p = 0.01) and raise swine and add antibiotics to feed (55.8%, p = 0.013), despite lower rates of atopy and personal histories of allergy, suggests the need for awareness and prevention measures and more population-based studies to further assess environmental and genetic determinants of asthma among farm children.

Both characteristics determine the outcome of COPD, a disease with frequent cardiac comorbidity requiring beta-blocker treatment. Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study. Setting: An ambulatory, hospital outpatient clinic of pulmonary diseases. Patients: Patients with mild-to-moderate irreversible COPD and AHR. Intervention: Fifteen patients received propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), celiprolol (200 mg), or placebo for 4 days, followed by a washout period >= 3 days. On day 4 of treatment, FEV1 and PC20 were assessed. Immediately hereafter, formoterol (12 mu g) was administered and FEV1 was measured for up to 30 min. Results: PC20 was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with propranolol and metoprolol treatment (geometric means, 2.06 mg/mL and 2.02 mg/mL, respectively) than with placebo (3.16 mg/mL) or celiprolol (3.41 mg/mL). FEV1 deteriorated only after propranolol treatment (2.08 +/- 0.31 L) [mean +/- SD] compared with placebo (2.24 +/- 0.37 L). The fast bronchodilating effect of formoterol was hampered by propranolol (mean increase in FEV1 at 3 min, 6.7 +/- 8.9%) but was unaffected by the other beta-blockers (16.9 +/- 9.8%, 22 +/- 11.6%, and 16.9 +/- 9.0% for placebo, metoprolol, and celiprolol, respectively). Conclusions: Pulmonary effects did not occur by celiprolol. Only propranolol reduced FEV1 and the bronchodilating effect of formoterol. Both metoprolol and propranolol increased AHR. Thus, different classes of beta-blockers have different pulmonary effects. The anticipated beneficial cardiovascular effects of a P-blocker must be weighted against the putative detrimental pulmonary effects, ie, effect on FEV1 AHR, and response to additional beta(2)-agonists.

Objective: Our objective was to study antibodies to cat and mite allergens and their relationship to wheezing in a country with high exposure to both allergens. Methods: Sera from 112 wheezing and 112 control children aged 10 to 11 years in a nested case-control study in New Zealand were assayed for specific IgE antibody, as well as IgG antibody and IgG4 antibody, to Der p 1 and Fel d 1. Results: IgE antibody to both mite (99/224) and cat (41/224) were strongly associated with wheezing (odds ratios, 5.2 and 6.5, respectively). Children who had ever lived with a cat were less likely to have IgE antibody to cat (20/141 vs 21/83, P <.04); however, cat ownership had no effect on IgE antibody to mite (67/141 vs 32/83, P =.23). Among sensitized children, cat ownership was associated with a lower prevalence of IgE antibody to cat (28% vs 66%, P <.001), and this analysis remained significant after exclusion of children whose families had chosen not to own a cat. Among sensitized subjects, the mean titer of IgE antibody to cat (1.7 IU/mL) was 10-fold lower than for mite (22.1 IU/mL). A cat in the home had no significant effect on endotoxin or mite allergen in house dust, whereas cat allergen was much higher (40.8 vs 3.3 mug/g). Conclusion: The response to these 2 allergens was distinct on the basis of the prevalence of sensitization, the titer of IgE antibody, and the effect of cat ownership. The results suggest that induction of tolerance to cat allergen is an allergen-specific phenomenon that cannot be attributed to endotoxin or family choice. The strength of the IgE antibody response to dust mite in humid climates could contribute to the increased prevalence and severity of asthma.

This is likely to be the result of increased exposure to environmental factors. A study was undertaken to investigate the association between maternal use of chemical based products in the prenatal period and patterns of wheeze in early childhood. Methods: In the population based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), the frequency of use of 11 chemical based domestic products was determined from questionnaires completed by women during pregnancy and a total chemical burden (TCB) score was derived. Four mutually exclusive wheezing patterns were defined for the period from birth to 42 months based on parental questionnaire responses ( never wheezed, transient early wheeze, persistent wheeze, and late onset wheeze). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between these wheezing outcomes and TCB exposure while accounting for numerous potential confounding variables. Complete data for analysis was available for 7019 of 13 971 (50%) children. Results: The mean (SD) TCB score was 9.4 (4.1), range 0 - 30. Increased use of domestic chemical based products was associated with persistent wheezing during early childhood ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) per unit increase of TCB 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.09)) but not with transient early wheeze or late onset wheeze. Children whose mothers had high TCB scores (>90th centile) were more than twice as likely to wheeze persistently throughout early childhood than children whose mothers had a low TCB score (<10th centile) ( adjusted OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.4)). Conclusion: These findings suggest that frequent use of chemical based products in the prenatal period is associated with persistent wheezing in young children. Follow up of this cohort is underway to determine whether TCB is associated with wheezing, asthma, and atopy at later stages in childhood.

Screening dust mite extracts through 137,180 tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates allowed for the characterization of proteolytic substrate specificity from the potential cysteine and serine proteases in the extract. The extract was further screened against a 4000 member peptide nucleic acid (PNA) encoded inhibitor library designed to target cysteine proteases using microarray detection. Affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identified Der p 1 as one of the proteases targeted by the PNA inhibitors in the dust mite lysate. A phenotypic readout of Der p 1 function in allergy progression was demonstrated by the inhibition of CD25 cleavage from T cells by dust mite extract that had been treated with the Der p I inhibitor identified from the PNA-encoded inhibitor library.

Individual particle aggregates were collected on carbon/formvar-coated 3 mm nickel grids and examined in a transmission electron microscope, utilizing bright-field imaging, selected-area electron diffraction analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry techniques. The natural gas and propane gas sources were domestic (kitchen) stoves, and similar particle aggregates collected in the outdoor air were correspondingly identified as carbon nanocrystal aggregates and sometimes more complex aggregates of silica nanocrystals intermixed with the carbon nanotubes and other carbon nanocrystals. Finally, and in light of the potential for methane-series gas burning as major sources of carbon nanocrystal aggregates in both the indoor and outdoor air, data for natural gas consumption and corresponding asthma deaths and incidence are examined with a degree of speculation regarding any significance in the correlations.

As the Langerhans cells migrate, they undergo a maturation process. It has been proposed that contact allergen exposure can induce DC maturation. While changes in DC gene expression profiles induced by various maturation stimuli have been explored, there are no published reports describing genomic-scale analysis of the changes induced by chemical allergen exposure. Therefore, to explore the concept of chemical allergen-induced DC maturation and to identify genes that are regulated by exposure to allergens we examined, at the transcriptional level, the effects of exposure to a contact allergen on DC. Peripheral blood-derived DC were exposed for 24 h to either 1 mM or 5 mM dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS). Changes in gene expression were analyzed using Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChip(R). Comparison of mean signal values from replicate cultures revealed 173 genes that were significantly different (P less than or equal to 0.001) between 1 mM DNBS treated and untreated control DC and 1249 significant gene changes between 5 mM DNBS treated and control DC. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the observed transcript changes for selected genes in DC derived from a second donor. Comparison of the fold-changes in transcript levels between the two platforms and donors revealed a good correlation in both direction and magnitude. RT-PCR analysis was also used to assess the allergen specificity of a selected number of genes in DC derived from a third donor. Many of the gene expression changes were found to be induced only by exposure to the allergen, DNBS, and not by exposure to a structurally similar non-allergen, benzenesulfonic acid. A number of gene expression changes induced by allergen exposure were found to be consistent with what is known of the DC maturation process, and thus provide support for the theory of contact allergen-induced DC maturation. Additionally, it is hoped that some of the transcript changes identified through this approach will be shown to be suitable for use in the development of an in vitro predictive assay for contact sensitization.

At school age, the amount of endotoxin measured in the dust of children's mattresses is inversely related to the occurrence of atopic asthma, hayfever and atopic sensitization both in children from farming and non-farming households. Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate which home and lifestyle characteristics of farm and non-farm families contribute to endotoxin levels measured in different indoor home environments. Methods In the framework of the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) Study, endotoxin was measured in dust samples from the living room floor and the child's mattress of 319 farmers' families and 493 non-farming families, and in settled dust from stables. Endotoxin content of all dust samples was determined by a kinetic Limulus assay (Limulus-Amebocyte-Lysate test). Information about the child's activities on farms, home characteristics and cleaning behaviours was obtained from parental questionnaires. Results Endotoxin levels in stables did not predict the amount of endotoxin measured in floors or mattresses. However, a dose-dependent association between the child's activity on the farm and indoor home endotoxin levels was observed, both in farm and non-farm children. In non-farm children pet keeping and the frequency of floor cleaning were additionally associated with endotoxin levels, whereas in farm children parental farm activities, study area, time since last cleaning, the mattress type as well as younger age of the children contributed to increased microbial exposure. Conclusion These results demonstrate that regular contact to farm animals increases indoor home endotoxin concentrations, both in farm and non-farm children, and might thus explain the protective effect of contact to livestock on atopic outcomes. To assess children's individual exposure to a microbial environment, measures of mattress dust exposure are needed as stable endotoxin concentrations were not associated with indoor home levels.

The goal of this study was to examine the characteristics of public schools (grades K-12) in California (n = 7,460) by proximity to major roads. We determined maximum daily traffic counts for all roads within 150 m of the school using a statewide road network and a geographic information system. Statewide, 173 schools (2.3%) with a total enrollment of 150,323 students were located within 150 m of high-traffic roads (greater than or equal to 50,000 vehides/day); 536 schools (7.2%) were within 150 m of medium-traffic roads (25,000-49,999 vehicles/day). Traffic exposure was related to race/ethnicity. For example, the overall percentage of nonwhite students was 78% at the schools located near high-traffic roads versus 60% at the schools with very low exposure (no streets with counted traffic data within 150 m). As the traffic exposure of schools increased, the percentage of both non-Hispanic black and Hispanic students attending the schools increased substantially. Traffic exposure was also related to school-based and census-tract-based socioeconomic indicators, including English language learners. The median percentage of children enrolled in free or reduced-price meal programs increased from 40.7% in the group with very low exposure to 60.5% in the highest exposure group. In summary, a substantial number of children in California attend schools dose to major roads with very high traffic counts, and a disproportionate number of those students are economically disadvantaged and nonwhite.

We followed 238 infants prospectively from birth to I year of age. At birth and at 3 months of age, IFNgamma production from polyclonally stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels in plasma were measured. The odds of developing recurrent wheezing (assessed by questionnaire) in the first year of life were up to 4.5 times higher for children in the lowest quartile of IFNgamma production at 3 months (p = 0.0005) and 3.2 times higher for children in the lowest quartile of sCD14 levels at birth (p = 0.004) as compared with children in the other 3 combined quartiles of IFNgamma and sCD14, respectively. Findings were confirmed in the multivariate analysis. IFNgamma production at 3 months and sCD14 levels at birth were correlated (r = 0.188, p = 0.031). Our findings from a longitudinal cohort suggest that impaired IFNgamma production at 3 months and reduced plasmasCD14 levels at birth significantly increase the risk of developing recurrent wheezing in the first year of life.

Despite the availability of effective chemotherapy the intensely itching lesions engender significant morbidity primarily due to secondary sepsis and post-infective complications. Some patients experience an extreme form of the disease, crusted scabies, in which many hundreds of mites may infest the skin causing severe crusting and hyperkeratosis. Overcrowded living conditions and poverty have been identified as significant confounding factors in transmission of the mite in humans. Control is hindered by difficulties with diagnosis, the cost of treatment, evidence for emerging resistance and lack of effective vaccines. Historically research on scabies has been extremely limited because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of the organism. Recent molecular approaches have enabled considerable advances in the study of population genetics and transmission dynamics of S. scabiei. However, the most exciting and promising development is the potential exploitation of newly available data from S. scabiei cDNA libraries and EST projects. Ultimately this knowledge may aid early identification of disease, novel forms of chemotherapy, vaccine development and new treatment possibilities for this important but neglected parasite.

Conversely, little is known about the impact of ongoing airway inflammation on pulmonary DC biology. In noninflammatory conditions, expression of T cell costimulatory molecules on mouse airway DCs is low and only upregulated after homing into draining thoracic lymph nodes. In this study, we reveal that ongoing allergic airway inflammation induces a premature upregulation of the T cell costimulatory molecules CD40, B7-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on DCs still present in the airways. In contrast, high surface expression of inducible costimulator ligand, involved in respiratory tolerance induction is restricted to DCs from noninflamed lungs. In addition, during inflammation the migratory flux of allergen-transporting airway DCs toward draining thoracic nodes increases both in amplitude as well as in speed. Remarkably, migratory DCs from inflamed airways are short-lived in the draining lymph nodes, a finding that is temporally associated with a marked loss of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in these cells. This study demonstrates the profound effects of ongoing allergen-driven airway inflammation on the dynamics of pulmonary DC physiology, a knowledge that could be exploited in the development of novel DC-based immunotherapies.

Epidemiological studies, however, indicate little about its association with climatic factors and air pollution. The relationship between traffic-related air pollutants and allergic rhinitis in middle-school students was therefore investigated. In a nationwide survey of middle-school students in Taiwan conducted in 1995/1996, the lifetime prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis and typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis were compared with air-monitoring station data on temperature, relative humidity, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (03), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 PM (PM10). A total of 331,686 nonsmoking children attended schools located within 2 km of 55 stations. Mean (range) annual exposures were: CO 853 (381-1,610) parts per billion (ppb), NOx 35.1 (10.2-72.4) ppb, SO2 7.57 (0.88-21.2) ppb, PM10 69.2 (40.1-116.2) mug.m(-3), O-3 21.3 (12.4-34.1) ppb, temperature 22.9 (19.6-25.1)degreesC, and relative humidity 76.2 (64.8-86.2)%. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis was 28.6 and 19.5% in males and females, respectively, with prevalence of questionnaire-determined allergic rhinitis 42.4 and 34.0%. After adjustment for age, parental education and history of atopic eczema, physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis was found to be associated with higher nonsummer (September-May) warmth and traffic-related air pollutants, including CO, NOx and O-3. Questionnaire-determined allergic rhinitis correlated only with traffic-related air pollutants. Nonsummer warmth and traffic-related air pollution, probably mediated through exposure to common allergens such as dust mites, are possible risk factors for allergic rhinitis in middle-school-aged children.

Many attempts have been made to develop in vitro sensitization tests that employ DCs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC-DC) or CD34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34 + HPC) purified from cord blood or bone marrow. However, the use of the DCs in in vitro methods has been difficult due to the nature of these cells such as low levels in the source and/or donor-to-donor variability. In our studies, we employed the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, in order to avoid some of these difficulties. At the start, we examined whether treatment of the cells with various cytokines could produce DCs from THP-1. Treatment of THP-1 cells with cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-alpha, and/or PMA did induce some phenotypic changes in THP-1 cells that were characteristic of DCs. Subsequently, responses to a known sensitizer, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and a non-sensitizer, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, CD54 and CD86, were examined between the naive cells and the cytokine-treated cells. Interestingly, the naive THP-1 cells responded only to DNCB and the response to the sensitizer was more distinct than cytokine-treated THP-1 cells. Similar phenomena were also observed in the human myeloid leukemia cell line, KG-l. Furthermore, with treatment of DNCB, naive THP-1 cells showed augmented expression of HLA, CD80 and secretion of IL-1beta. The response of THP-1 cells to a sensitizer was similar to that of LCs/DCs. Upon demonstrating the differentiation of monocyte cells in our system, we then evaluated a series of chemicals, including known sensitizers and non-sensitizers, for their potential to augment CD54 and CD86 expression on naive THP-1 cells. Indeed, known sensitizers such as PPD and 2-MBT significantly augmented CD54 and CD86 expression in a dose-dependent manner while non-sensitizers, such as SLS and methyl salicylate (MS), did not. To note, the metal allergens such as (NH4)(2)[PtCl4], NiSO4 and CoSO4 augmented significantly only CD54 expression. Taking advantage of a cultured cell line, measurement of the co-stimulatory molecules, CD54 and CD86, on naive THP-1 cells following chemical exposure shows promise for the development of a simple, short-term in vitro sensitization test.

In order to redress the fetal Th1/Th2 imbalance, Th1-stimulating factors, such as bacterial endotoxin, may be required. The increasing prevalence and severity of atopic diseases in industrialized countries, which are in marked contrast with the low prevalence of allergy among children in the formerly socialist countries of Europe, have been suggested to be caused by a reduced microbial stimulation. Aim To relate the endotoxin levels in house dust from two countries with a low (Estonia) and a high (Sweden) prevalence of allergy to the development of atopic disease and sensitization in the children during the first 2 years of life. Methods The study included 108 children from Tartu, Estonia and 111 children from Linkoping, Sweden. Skin prick tests were performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age, and questionnaires were distributed to the families. At 24 months, a paediatrician examined the children. Dust samples were collected from mattresses and carpets and the endotoxin concentration was determined by a chromogenic Limulus assay. Results The endotoxin levels were higher in Estonian than in Swedish house dust (median levels 29 (range 0.25-280) and 14 (range 0.25-99) EU/mg dust, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels were inversely related to the development of atopic disease and sensitization in the Swedish, but not in the Estonian, children. Conclusions The low prevalence of atopic disease in Estonia may, at least in part, be related to the high endotoxin levels in this country. The findings support that high levels of endotoxin, or other bacterial products with Th1-stimulating properties, might protect children from developing atopic disease.

This study tested the efficacy of coaching to reduce environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure among asthmatic Latino children. Design. After asthma management education, families were randomly assigned to no additional service (control condition) or to coaching for ETS exposure reduction (experimental condition). Setting. The study was conducted in San Diego, California. Participants. Two hundred four Latino children (ages 3-17 years) with asthma participated. Intervention. Approximately 1.5 hours of asthma management education was provided; experimental families also obtained 7 coaching sessions (similar to45 minutes each) to reduce ETS exposure. Outcome Measures. Reported ETS exposure and children's urine cotinine were measured. Results. Parents in the coached condition reported their children exposed to significantly fewer cigarettes than parents of control children by 4 months (postcoaching). Reported prevalence of exposed children decreased to 52% for the coached families, but only to 69% for controls. By month 4, mean cotinine levels decreased among coached and increased among control children. Cotinine prevalence decreased from 54% to 40% among coached families, while it increased from 43% to 49% among controls. However, cotinine levels decreased among controls to the same level achieved by coached families by the 13-month follow-up. Conclusions. Asthma management education plus coaching can reduce ETS exposure more than expected from education alone, and decreases in the coached condition may be sustained for about a year. The delayed decrease in cotinine among controls is discussed.

Others have reported that antibodies for DIISO-HSA are specific but insensitive markers of DA. This study was performed to evaluate test characteristics of the in vitro MCP-1 assay compared with DIISO-HSA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE in identifying workers with DA. MCPA was quantitated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell supernatants 48 hours after incubation with DIISO-HSA antigens. Assay results were compared with outcomes of specific inhalation challenge (SIC) testing. Nineteen of 54 (35%) workers assayed for antibodies and MCPA stimulation had SIC-confirmed DA. Mean MCP-1 produced by SIC-positive workers was greater than SIC-negative workers (p less than or equal to 0.001). Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and test efficiency for specific IgG were 47%, 74%, and 65%, respectively, and for specific IgE were 21%, 89%, and 65%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and test efficiency of the MCPA test were 79%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. This study indicates that the MCP-1 stimulation assay has greater sensitivity and specificity than the specific antibody assays in correctly identifying DA.

Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to determine risk factors for single and multiple hospital admissions for asthma. Methods: The members of a population-based, unselected birth cohort of 1037 New Zealanders answered questionnaires and underwent lung function, airway responsiveness, and allergy testing on 7 occasions to the age of 26 years. Results: Among the 766 study members (74% of the cohort) who reported wheezing symptoms ever by the age of 26 years, 136 hospitalizations were reported by 62 individuals (8.3% of those at risk, 6.2% of the total cohort). Only 55 of these 136 admissions involved children less than 9 years of age; admissions continued to occur between the ages of 9 and 18 years (40 admissions) and at >18 years (41 admissions). Those admitted were predominantly male, had earlier ages of onset of symptoms, were more atopic, and had more airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine than those not admitted. Frequent symptoms and low lung function were evident among the 45 study members with single admissions and even more evident among the 17 study members with multiple (2-10) admissions. Conclusions: A surprisingly large fraction of this unselected population experienced hospitalization for asthma during the 26-year follow-up, many being admitted in later childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.

To explore the risk factors that have been suggested to be associated with the development of SLE. Methods. A case-control study was performed and a questionnaire was developed to obtain the data. Consecutive female incident cases diagnosed between 1981 and 1999 in a defined,geographical area in southern Sweden were included. Controls, matched for calendar year of birth, were selected randomly from the same area. In total, 85 cases and 205 controls agreed to participate. The questionnaire included questions about formal education, body weight and height, medical history, family history of autoimmune diseases, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, animals, hair-colouring dyes, alfalfa (lucerne) sprouts, smoking and alcohol habits, history of physical traumata, blood transfusion, silicone breast implants, exogenous oestrogens, other medication, and significant negative life events. Results. Using a multivariate model, a history of hypertension [odds ratio (OR)=3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-9.8], drug allergy (OR=3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.5), a type I/II sun-reactive Skin type (OR=2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8) and a family history of SLE (OR=6.8, 95% CI 1.4-32) were all significantly associated with an increased risk of developing SLE, whereas consumption of alcohol was inversely associated with the risk of SLE (use of alcohol very seldom, OR=1.0; 1-150 g/month, OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0; > 150 g/month, OR=0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). A suggested association with increased SLE risk was seen for smoking (OR=1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.6) and blood transfusions (OR=23, 95% CI 0.9-5.8). Neither exposure to exogenous oestrogen nor exposure to hair-colouring dyes was associated with SLE. Conclusions. Risk factors of both exogenous and endogenous origin were identified in this population-based series of SLE patients.

The increase may be associated with decreased rates of infections such as measles., hepatitis A, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and, as recently suggested, Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Objective Since the increase of atopy has been mainly based on clinical studies. we wanted to study the prevalence of allergen-specific Immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies in two cross-sectional, adult population-based serum samples two decades apart. Since the sera had been tested for H. pylori antibodies, we also had a chance to look for a possible relationship between these two findings. Methods We determined the prevalence rate of allergen-specific serum IgE antibodies against birch and timothy pollen, and cat and dog epithelium allergens by the radioallergosorbent test in a 15-54-years-old Finnish population using 326 sera collected in 1973 and 319 sera collected in 1994 from randomly selected subjects. Results From 1973 to 1994 allergen-specific IgE prevalence rates and IgE antibody levels rose. In 1994, the prevalence rate of positive findings in 15-24-year-old population had increased from I I to 38% (3.5-fold increase, P=0.0001, OR 5.12, Cl 95% 2.32-11.3). In older 10-year age groups similar trends did not reach significance, but the overall change was significant with all three cut-off levels of allergen-specific IgE analysed. The percentage of IgE-positive persons rose mainly in the subgroup with no H. pylori antibodies. In 1994 21% of the H. pylori-negative subjects had IgE antibodies compared with 5% of the H. pylori-positive subjects (in 1973 11% in both subgroups). Conclusions IgE-based evidence for an increase in IgE-mediated allergy was uncovered. The increase occurred mainly in the subgroup with no antibodies to H. pylori, which support the hypothesis that H, pylori could be one of the microbes counteracting atopy.

The coexistence of AR and asthma is complex. First, the diagnosis of asthma may be confounded by symptoms of cough caused by rhinitis and postnasal drip. This may lead to either inaccurate diagnosis of asthma or inappropriate assessment of asthma severity with over treatment of the patient. The term "cough variant rhinitis" is therefore proposed to describe rhinitis that manifests itself primarily as cough that results from postnasal drip. AR, however, also has a causal role in asthma; it appears both to be responsible for exacerbating asthma and to have a role in its pathogenesis. Postnasal drip with nasopharyngeal inflammation leads to a number of other conditions. Thus sinusitis is a frequent extension of rhinitis and is one of the most frequently missed diagnoses In children. Allergen exposure in the nasopharynx with release of histamine and other mediators can cause Eustachian tube obstruction possibly leading to middle car effusions. Chronic allergic inflammation of the upper airway causes lymphoid hypertrophy with prominence of adenoidal and tonsillar tissue. This may be associated with poor appetite, poor growth, and obstructive sleep apnea. AR is therefore part of a spectrum of allergic disorders that can profoundly affect the well being and quality of life of a child. Prospective cohort studies are required to assess the disease burden caused by AR in childhood and to further assess the potential educational impairment that may result. Because AR is part of a systemic disease process, its management requires a coordinated approach rather than a fragmented, organ-based approach.

Several allergenic molecules with a high level of homology have been identified in divergent pollen families and named panallergens. Methods: We sought to define the criteria to evaluate the prevalence of the multiple pollen sensitization, to identify specific markers of this condition, and to correlate them with the underlying allergic disease. Patients presenting an allergic respiratory disease underwent skin testing with 23 pollens. Patients fulfilling predefined selection criteria were grouped and classified as having multiple pollen sensitization. Patients in each subgroup were tested for IgE to rBet v 2, rJun o 2, rBet v 1, rPhl p 5 and bromelain. Demographical, allergological and clinical data were recorded in the subgroup of patients with multiple pollen sensitization. Results: Seventeen percent of the pollen-sensitized patients formed the multiple pollen-sensitized subgroup. These subjects were positive for most of the pollen species tested regardless of known exposure to them. None of the subjects sensitized to less than six pollen species were positive to panallergens, whereas 55% of the sera of the multiple pollen-sensitized group were positive to rBet v 2, and 15% to rJun o 2. IgE to rBet v 1 and rPhl p 5 were found positive in all the subgroups. Age, gender, bronchial asthma, oral allergy syndrome, skin test reactivity and previous specific immunotherapy differed significantly when these two subsets were considered. Conclusions: Allergy diagnosis based on allergenic molecules is crucial in the patient with multiple pollen sensitization. This condition appears to be determined by the sensitization to defined allergenic components (panallergens) rather than by pollen of multiple species as such. Detection of IgE to nonpanallergenic molecules allows to identify more relevant allergenic sources. Clinical aspects of the underlying allergic disease (e.g. asthma and oral allergy syndrome) seem to be differently related to IgE reactivity to panallergens. Ccpyright (C) 2001 S.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of O-3 and NO2 on the release of IL-8, GM-CSF, RANTES, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) from human bronchial epithelial cells (HBF,Cs) of nonatopic nonasthmatic subjects (nonasthmatic subjects) and atopic subjects with mild asthma (asthmatic subjects) in vitro. Methods: We cultured HBECs from bronchial biopsy specimens of nonasthmatic and asthmatic subjects; exposed these for 6 hours to air, 10 to 100 ppb O-3, or 100 to 400 ppb NO2; and analyzed the release of IL-8, GM-CSF, RANTES, and sICAM-1 after 24 hours' incubation. Results: There was no significant difference between the constitutive release of IL-8, GM-CSF; and sICAM-1 from HBECs of asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects, RANTES was detected only in HBECs derived from asthmatic subjects. Exposure of HBECs of asthmatic subjects to both 50 to 100 ppb O-3 and 200 to 400 ppb NO2 significantly increased the release of IL-8, GM-CSF, RANTES, and sICAM-1 from these cells after 24 hours of incubation. However, 50 to 100 ppb O-3 and 200 to 400 ppb NO2 led to a significant increase in release of only IL-8 and sICAM-1 from HBECs of nonasthmatic subjects after 24 hours' incubation. A comparison between the pollutant-induced release of mediators demonstrated that 100 ppb O-3. induced release of GM-CSF and sICAM-1 was significantly greater in HBECs of asthmatic subjects (medians, 0.59 and 27.4 pg/mug cellular protein, respectively) than in HBECs of nonasthmatic subjects (medians, 0.27 and 14.4 pg/mug cellular protein, respectively; P<.02). Conclusion: These results suggest that O-3 and NO2 may modulate airway diseases, such as asthma, by increasing the release of inflammatory mediators from bronchial epithelial cells and that the cells of asthmatic subjects may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of these pollutants.

We have previously shown that human lung epithelial cell proteins can become conjugated with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and may be biologically important in diisocyanate-induced asthma. The objective of this study was to identify specific human lung and skin proteins that become conjugated with diisocyanate after in vitro and in vivo exposure. Following in vitro exposure of human airway epithelial cells (A549), keratin 18, the 78-kD glucose-regulated protein, trans-1,2-dihyrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase, and actin were identified as prominent diisocyanate-conjugated proteins through use of a combination of immunocytochemical and mass spectrometric techniques. Following in vivo inhalation of an HDI aerosol, keratin 18 was also identified as the predominant diisocyanate-conjugated protein in human endobronchial biopsy samples, whereas albumin was the predominant diisocyanate-conjugated protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Keratin was also identified as a predominant diisocyanate-conjugated protein in human skin biopsy samples after epicutaneous exposure to liquid-phase HDI, although the major skin diisocyanate-conjugated protein (56-kD) differed from the predominant lung diisocyanate-conjugated keratin (47-kD). The data from this study identify keratin and other proteins as potential "carriers" for diisocyanates in vivo, and suggest that HDI conjugation of these proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of diisocyanate-induced asthma.

Lung autopsy specimens from the Fresno County Coroner's Office were prepared by intratracheal instillation of 2% glutaraldehyde at 30 cm H2O pressure. Two distinct airway paths into the apico-posterior and apico-anterior portions of the left upper lung lobe were followed. Tissue samples for histologic analysis were generally taken from the intrapulmonary second, fourth, sixth, and ninth airway generations. Parenchymal tissues beyond the 12th airway generation of each airway path were also analyzed. There was little evidence of visible particle accumulation in the larger conducting airways (generations 2-6), except in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissues and within peribronchial connective tissue. In contrast, terminal and respiratory bronchioles arising from each pathway revealed varying degrees of wall thickening and remodeling. Walls with marked thickening contained moderate to heavy amounts of carbonaceous and mineral dusts. Wall thickening was associated with increases in collagen and interstitial inflammatory cells, including dust-laden macrophages. These changes were significantly greater in first-generation respiratory bronchioles compared to second- and third-generation respiratory bronchioles. These findings suggest that accumulation of carbonaceous and mineral dust in the lungs is significantly affected by lung anatomy with the greatest retention in centers of lung acini. Furthermore, there is significant remodeling of this transitional zone in humans exposed to ambient particulate matter.

The study described here examined different particles, diesel exhaust particles (DEP), carbon black particles (CBP), and silica particles (SIP) for their immunomodulating capacity in both primary and secondary immune responses in female BALB/C mice. The primary response was studied after subcutaneous injection of 1 mg of particle together with 10 mug of reporter antigen TNP-OVA (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl coupled to ovalbumin) into the hind paw. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) production was assessed in the popliteal lymph node (PLN) at Day 2 and Day 5 after injection by flow cytometry and ELISA. The number of IL-4-containing CD4(+) T cells increased between Day 2 and Day 5 in DEP- and CBP-exposed mice, in contrast to SIP-treated animals. IL-4 production by cultured PLN cells was also significantly increased for DEP- and CBP-treated animals. The secondary response was studied in different organs after an intranasal challenge with TNP-OVA (50 mug), which was given 4 weeks after the initial subcutaneous injection. Five days after challenge the number of antibody-forming cells (AFCs) was assessed in peribronchial lymph nodes (PBLN), spleen, bone marrow, and PLN, and antibody levels were determined in weekly obtained blood samples. It appeared that all particles acted as adjuvant, but the different particles stimulated distinct types of immune responses to TNP-OVA. DEP-treated animals show high IgG1 and IgE levels in serum and high IgG1 and IgE-forming AFC numbers in PBLN, bone marrow, and spleen. CBP-treated animals show even higher IgG1 and IgE levels and AFC numbers, and in addition display IgG2a production. SIP-injected animals display predominantly IgG2a responses. It is concluded that DEP are able to skew the immune response toward the T helper 2 (Th2) side, whereas SIP stimulate a Th1 response and CBP have a mixed activity, stimulating both Th1 and Th2 responses in this model, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Changes in either the quantity or properties of airway smooth muscle (ASM) are possible explanations for AHR. Morphometric analyses demonstrate structural changes in asthmatic airways, including subepithelial fibrosis, gland hyperplasia/hypertrophy, neovascularization and an increase in ASM mass. Mathematical modelling of airway narrowing suggests that, of all the changes in structure, the increase in ASM mass is the most probable cause of AHR. An increase in ASM mass in the large airways is more closely associated with a greater likelihood of dying from asthma than increases in ASM mass in other locations within the airway tree. ASM contraction is opposed by the elastic recoil of the lungs and airways, which appears to limit the degree of bronchoconstriction in vivo. The cyclical nature of tidal breathing applies stresses to the airway wall that enhance the bronchodilating influence of the lung tissues on the contracting ASR;I, in all probability by disrupting cross-bridges. However, the increase in ASM mass in asthma may overcome the limitation resulting from the impedances to ASM shortening imposed by the lung parenchyma and airway wall tissues. Additionally, ASM with the capacity to shorten rapidly may achieve shorter lengths and cause a greater degree of bronchoconstriction when stimulated to contract than slower ASM. Changes in ASM properties are induced by the process of sensitization and allergen-exposure such as enhancement of phospholipase C activity and inositol phosphate turnover, and increases in myosin Light chain kinase activity, Whether changes in ASM mass or biochemical/biomechanical properties form the basis for asthma remains to be determined.

Design--A multicentre randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. Subjects--Infants admitted to hospital with their first episode of RSV positive bronchiolitis. Intervention-Randomised to receive either 1 mg of nebulised budesonide (Bud) or placebo (Pla) twice daily from admission until 2 weeks after discharge. Follow up was for 12 months. Main outcome measures--Duration of hospital admission, time taken to become symptom free, re-admission rates, general practitioner consultation rates, and use of antiwheeze medication during follow up. Results--161 infants were studied. Both arms were similar with respect to initial clinical severity, age, sex, socioeconomic class, and tobacco exposure, Median time from first nebulisation to discharge: Bud and Pla, 2 days. Median number of days for 50% of infants to be symptom free for 48 hours: Bud, 10 days; Ma, 12 days. Respiratory re-admission rates in the 12 month follow up: Bud, 16%; Pla, 18%; median difference (95% confidence interval (Cl)), -2 (-14 to 10). Median respiratory related general practitioner attendances: Bud, 4.0; Pla, 4.5; median difference (95% CI), -1 (-2 to 0). Percentage of infants recieving at least one prescription for antiwheeze medication during follow up, corticosteroids: Bud, 50%; Pla, 60%; difference (95% CI), -10 (-26 to 6);bronchodilators: Bud, 60%; Pla, 67%; difference (95% CI), -7 (-22 to 8). Conclusions--There are no short or long term clinical benefits from the administration of nebulised corticosteroids in the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis.

The Effects of Airway Microbiome on Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Asthma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						microbiome; asthma; corticosteroids	STEROID-RESISTANT ASTHMA; GLUCOCORTICOID-INSENSITIVE ASTHMA; PROTEIN-KINASE PHOSPHATASE-1; FIBEROPTIC BRONCHOSCOPY; COMMENSAL BACTERIA; RECEPTOR-BETA; LIPID-A; DISEASE; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDES; MACROPHAGES	Rationale: The role of airway microbiome in corticosteroid response in asthma is unknown. Objectives: To examine airway microbiome composition in patients with corticosteroid-resistant (CR) asthma and compare it with patients with corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) asthma and normal control subjects and explore whether bacteria in the airways of subjects with asthma may direct alterations in cellular responses to corticosteroids. Methods: 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) samples of 39 subjects with asthma and 12 healthy control subjects. In subjects with asthma, corticosteroid responsiveness was characterized, BAL macrophages were stimulated with pathogenic versus commensal microorganisms, and analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of corticosteroid-regulated genes and cellular p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 39 subjects with asthma, 29 were CR and 10 were CS. BAL microbiome from subjects with CR and CS asthma did not differ in richness, evenness, diversity, and community composition at the phylum level, but did differ at the genus level, with distinct genus expansions in 14 subjects with CR asthma. Preincubation of asthmatic airway macrophages with Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a uniquely expanded potential pathogen found only in CR asthma airways, resulted in p38 MAPK activation, increased IL-8 (P < 0.01), mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 mRNA (P < 0.01) expression, and inhibition of corticosteroid responses (P < 0.05). This was not observed after exposure to commensal bacterium Prevotella melaninogenica. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta-associated kinase-1 (TAK1), upstream activator of MAPK, but not p38 MAPK restored cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids. [GRAPHICS] Conclusions: A subset of subjects with CR asthma demonstrates airway expansion of specific gram-negative bacteria, which trigger TAK1/MAPK activation and induce corticosteroid resistance. TAK1 inhibition restored cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids.	[Goleva, Elena; Jackson, Leisa P.; Hall, Clifton F.; Gelfand, Erwin W.; Leung, Donald Y.

The clinical evidence reveals a general increase in both incidence and prevalence of respiratory diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (common hay fever) and asthma. Such phenomena may be related not only to air pollution and changes in lifestyle, but also to an actual increase in airborne quantities of allergenic pollen. Experimental enhancements of carbon dioxide (CO2) have demonstrated changes in pollen amount and allergenicity, but this has rarely been shown in the wider environment. The present analysis of a continental-scale pollen data set reveals an increasing trend in the yearly amount of airborne pollen for many taxa in Europe, which is more pronounced in urban than semi-rural/rural areas. Climate change may contribute to these changes, however increased temperatures do not appear to be a major influencing factor. Instead, we suggest the anthropogenic rise of atmospheric CO2 levels may be influential.

LINA Study Grp	Cord blood Tregs with stable FOXP3 expression are influenced by prenatal environment and associated with atopic dermatitis at the age of one year	ALLERGY			English	Article						birth cohort; cord blood; environmental exposure; FOXP3; regulatory T cells	REGULATORY T-CELLS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; MATERNAL SMOKING; DNA METHYLATION; LINEAGE; INDUCTION; PREGNANCY; CHILDREN; DISEASE	Background: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) with stable FOXP3 expression are characterized by a specific demethylated region in the FOXP3 gene (Treg-specific demethylated region, TSDR). The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of prenatal factors on cord blood Treg numbers, as detected by changes in the TSDR demethylation, and the subsequent risk for allergic diseases. Methods: Analyses were performed within the LINA study in blood samples from pregnant women (34th gestational week) and in cord blood (n = 346 mother-child pairs). Treg numbers were detected via DNA demethylation in the FOXP3 TSDR. At age 1, total and specific IgE was measured in children's blood. In addition, maternal cytokine production (Th1/ Th2/ Th17) was analysed. Exposure and disease outcomes were assessed by questionnaires. Results: Boys had lower Treg numbers compared with girls (P < 0.001). Parental atopy history, particularly maternal hay fever and paternal asthma were related to lower Treg numbers in cord blood (adj. MR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68-0.97; adj. MR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.45-0.81). Maternal cytokines (IL-13, IL-17E and IFN-gamma) and maternal smoking/ exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy were also associated with decreased cord blood Treg numbers (adj. MR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00). Children with lower Treg numbers at birth had a higher risk to develop atopic dermatitis (adj. OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.00-2.41) and sensitization to food allergens (adj. OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.06-2.25) during the first year of life. Conclusions: These results indicate that both genetic and environmental factors presumably influence the development of foetal Tregs. Low cord blood Treg numbers may predict early atopic dermatitis.

Oxidative Stress-induced Antibodies to Carbonyl-modified Protein Correlate with Severity of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						COPD; autoimmunity; oxidative stress; carbonyl	LIPID-PEROXIDATION PRODUCTS; CIGARETTE-SMOKE; INDUCED EMPHYSEMA; T-CELLS; COPD; AUTOANTIBODIES; AUTOIMMUNITY; MICE; AUTOANTIGENS; INFLAMMATION	Rationale: There is increasing evidence for the presence of autoantibodies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic oxidative stress is an essential component in COPD pathogenesis and can lead to increased levels of highly reactive carbonyls in the lung, which could result in the formation of highly immunogenic carbonyl adducts on "self" proteins. Objectives: To determine the presence of autoantibodies to carbonyl-modified protein in patients with COPD and in a murine model of chronic ozone exposure. To assess the extent of activated immune responses toward carbonyl-modified proteins. Methods: Blood and peripheral lung were taken from patients with COPD, age-matched smokers, and nonsmokers with normal lung function, as well as patients with severe persistent asthma. Mice were exposed to ambient air or ozone for 6 weeks. Antibody titers were measured by ELISA, activated compliment deposition by immunohistochemistry, and cellular activation by ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Measurements and Main Results: Antibody titer against carbonyl-modified self-protein was significantly increased in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage III COPD compared with control subjects. Antibody levels inversely correlated with disease severity and showed a prevalence toward an IgG1 isotype. Deposition of activated complement in the vessels of COPD lung as well as autoantibodies against endothelial cells were also observed. Ozone-exposed mice similarly exhibited increased antibody titers to carbonyl-modified protein, as well as activated antigen-presenting cells in lung tissue and splenocytes sensitized to activation by carbonyl-modified protein. Conclusions: Carbonyl-modified proteins, arising as a result of oxidative stress, promote antibody production, providing a link by which oxidative stress could drive an autoimmune response in COPD.

Peat Bog Wildfire Smoke Exposure in Rural North Carolina Is Associated with Cardiopulmonary Emergency Department Visits Assessed through Syndromic Surveillance	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						cardiopulmonary health effects; satellite data; syndromic surveillance; wildfire smoke exposure	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES; CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; FOREST-FIRES; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; ROOM VISITS; URBAN AREA; QUALITY; MORTALITY	BACKGROUND: In June 2008, burning peat deposits produced haze and air pollution far in excess of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, encroaching on rural communities of eastern North Carolina. Although the association of mortality and morbidity with exposure to urban air pollution is well established, the health effects associated with exposure to wildfire emissions are less well understood. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of exposure on cardiorespiratory outcomes in the population affected by the fire. METHODS: We performed a population-based study using emergency department (ED) visits reported through the syndromic surveillance program NC DETECT (North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool). We used aerosol optical depth measured by a satellite to determine a high-exposure window and distinguish counties most impacted by the dense smoke plume from surrounding referent counties. Poisson log-linear regression with a 5-day distributed lag was used to estimate changes in the cumulative relative risk (RR). RESULTS: In the exposed counties, significant increases in cumulative RR for asthma [1.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.1)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1.73 (1.06-2.83)], and pneumonia and acute bronchitis [1.59 (1.07-2.34)] were observed. ED visits associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms [1.23 (1.06-1.43)] and heart failure [1.37 (1.01-1.85)] were also significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Satellite data and syndromic surveillance were combined to assess the health impacts of wildfire smoke in rural counties with sparse air-quality monitoring. This is the first study to demonstrate both respiratory and cardiac effects after brief exposure to peat wildfire smoke.

Inhaled corticosteroids as combination therapy with beta-adrenergic agonists in airways disease: present and future	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Asthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Corticosteroids; Beta-adrenergic agonists; Inflammation	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HISTONE DEACETYLASE ACTIVITY; MILD PERSISTENT ASTHMA; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; LONG-TERM TREATMENT; AIR-FLOW OBSTRUCTION; NITRIC-OXIDE LEVELS; LOW-DOSE BUDESONIDE; REGULATORY T-CELLS	Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy in combination with long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists represents the most important treatment for chronic airways diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ICS therapy forms the basis for treatment of asthma of all severities, improving asthma control, lung function and preventing exacerbations of disease. Use of ICS has also been established in the treatment of COPD, particularly symptomatic patients, who experience useful gains in quality of life, likely from an improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness and in reduction in exacerbations, and an attenuation of the yearly rate of deterioration in lung function. The addition of long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) therapy with ICS increases the efficacy of ICS effects in moderate-to-severe asthma. Thus, a 800 mu g daily dose of the ICS budesonide reduced severe exacerbation rates by 49% compared to a low dose of 200 mu g daily, and addition of the LABA formoterol to budesonide (800 mu g) led to a 63% reduction. In COPD, the effects of ICS are less prominent but there are beneficial effects on the decline in FEV(1) and the rate of exacerbations. A reduction in the rate of decline in FEV(1) of 16 ml/year with a 25% reduction in exacerbation rate has been reported with the salmeterol and fluticasone combination. A non-significant 17.5% reduction in all-cause mortality rate with ICS and LABA is reported. Chronic inflammation is a feature of both asthma and COPD, although there are site and characteristic differences. ICS targets this inflammation although this effect of ICS is less effective in patients with severe asthma and with COPD; however, addition of LABA may potentiate the anti-inflammatory effects of ICS. An important consideration is the presence of corticosteroid insensitivity in these patients. Currently available ICS have variably potent binding activities to specific glucocorticoid receptors, leading to inhibition of gene expression by either binding to DNA and inducing anti-inflammatory genes or by repressing the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators. Local side effects of ICS include oral candidiasis, hoarseness and dysphonia, while systemic side effects, such as easy bruising and reduction in growth velocity or bone mineral densitometry, are usually restricted to doses above maximally recommended doses. Use of LABA alone in patients with asthma increases the risk of asthma-related events including deaths, but this is less observed with the combination of ICS and LABA. Therefore, use of LABA alone is not recommended for asthma therapy. Future progress in ICS development will be characterised by the introduction of ICS with greater efficacy with a limited side-effect profile, and by longer-acting ICS that can be used in combination with once-daily LABAs. Other agents that could improve the efficacy of corticosteroids or reverse corticosteroid insensitivity may be added to ICS. ICS in combination with LABAs will continue to remain the main focus of treatment of airways diseases.

Alternatively Activated Macrophages Elicited by Helminth Infection Can Be Reprogrammed to Enable Microbial Killing	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS; CD4(+) T-CELLS; TUMOR-INFILTRATING MACROPHAGES; LEISHMANIA-MEXICANA INFECTION; OXIDE-SYNTHESIZING PATHWAY; SYNTHASE ARGINASE BALANCE; SELECTIVE UP-REGULATION; IN-VIVO; PERITONEAL-MACROPHAGES; MURINE MACROPHAGES	The prime function of classically activated macrophages (activated by Th1-type signals, such as IFN-gamma) is microbial destruction. Alternatively activated macrophages (activated by Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13) play important roles in allergy and responses to helminth infection. We utilize a murine model of filarial infection, in which adult nematodes are surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity of mice, as an in vivo source of alternatively activated macrophages. At 3 wk postinfection, the peritoneal exudate cell population is dominated by macrophages, termed nematode-elicited macrophages (NeM phi), that display IL-4-dependent features such as the expression of arginase 1, RELM-alpha (resistin-like molecule alpha), and Ym1. Since increasing evidence suggests that macrophages show functional adaptivity, the response of NeM phi to proinflammatory Th1-activating signals was investigated to determine whether a switch between alternative and classical activation could occur in macrophages differentiated in an in vivo infection setting. Despite the long-term exposure to Th2 cytokines and antiinflammatory signals in vivo, we found that NeM phi were not terminally differentiated but could develop a more classically activated phenotype in response to LPS and IFN-gamma. This was reflected by a switch in the enzymatic pathway for arginine metabolism from arginase to inducible NO synthase and the reduced expression of RELM-alpha and Ym1. Furthermore, this enabled NeM phi to become antimicrobial, as LPS/IFN-gamma-treated NeM phi produced NO that mediated killing of Leishmania mexicana. However, the adaptation to antimicrobial function did not extend to key regulatory pathways, such as IL-12 production, which remained unaltered. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182: 3084-3094.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is an unusual occurrence with few cases reported. It is seen after intrathoracic pressure changes leading to alveolar rupture and dissection of air along the tracheobronchial tree. This study was undertaken to provide a thorough clinical and radiologic analysis of this patient population. Methods. A retrospective comparative analysis was performed on patients with SPM over 12 years. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, and radiographic and diagnostic studies were recorded. A clinical and radiologic comparison was performed with secondary pneumomediastinum. Results. Seventy-four patients were identified with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. A total of 28 patients with SPM were identified. The major initial complaints were chest pain (54%), shortness of breath (39%), and subcutaneous emphysema (32%). The main triggering events were emesis (36%) and asthma flare-ups (21%). No apparent triggering event was noted in 21% of patients. Chest radiograph was diagnostic in 69%; computed tomography was required in 31%. Esophagram, esophagoscopy, and bronchoscopy were performed on an individual basis and were invariably negative. When compared with secondary pneumomediastinum, SPM is more likely to be discovered by chest radiography, has a lower incidence of pneumothorax and pleural effusion, requires a shorter hospital stay, and has no associated mortality. Conclusions. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a benign condition that often presents with chest pain or dyspnea. It can develop without a triggering event and with no findings on chest radiography. Treatment is expectant and recurrence is low. Secondary causes must be ruled out to avoid an unfavorable outcome.

Most studies have analyzed floor or mattress dust endotoxin, but its validity as a proxy for airborne exposure is unknown, while active airborne dust sampling is not feasible in large-scale population studies because of logistic and financial limitations. We therefore developed and evaluated a simple passive airborne dust collection method for airborne endotoxin exposure assessment. We explored an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC), consisting of a 42- by 29.6-cm-sized folder with four electrostatic cloths exposed to the air. The EDC was tested during two 14-day periods in seven nonfarm and nine farm homes and in farm stables. In parallel, active airborne dust sampling was performed with Harvard impactors and floor dust collected by vacuuming, using nylon sampling socks. The endotoxin levels could be measured in all EDC cloth extracts. The levels (in EU/m(2)) between EDCs used simultaneously or in different sampling periods in the same home correlated strongly (r > 0.8). EDC endotoxin also correlated moderately to strongly (r = 0.6 to 0.8) with the endotoxin measured by active airborne dust sampling and living room floor dust sampling and-in farm homes-with the endotoxin captured by the EDC in stables. In contrast, endotoxin levels measured by floor dust sampling showed only a poor correlation with the levels measured by active airborne dust sampling. We therefore conclude that measuring endotoxin levels with the EDC is a valid measure of average airborne endotoxin exposure, while reproducibility over time is at least equivalent to that of reservoir dust analyses.

Size distribution and total number concentration of ultrafine and accumulation mode particles and hospital admissions in children and the elderly in Copenhagen, Denmark	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; 5 EUROPEAN CITIES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; URBAN AIR; FINE; AMBIENT; HEALTH; INDOOR	Objectives: To study the association between short-term exposure to ultrafine particles and morbidity in Copenhagen, Denmark. Methods: We studied the association between urban background levels of the total number concentration of particles (NCtot, 6-700 nm in diameter) measured at a single site (15 May 2001 to 31 December 2004) and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular (CVD) and respiratory disease (RD) in the elderly (age >= 65 years), and due to asthma in children (age 5-18 years). We examined these associations in the presence of PM10, PM2.5 (particulate matter < 10 and 2.5 mu m in diameter, respectively) and ambient gasses. We utilised data on size distribution to calculate NCtot for four modes with median diameters 12, 23, 57 and 212 nm, and NC100 (number concentration of particles < 100 nm in diameter) and examined their associations with health outcomes. We used a time series Poisson generalised additive model adjusted for overdispersion, season, day of the week, public holidays, school holidays, influenza, pollen and meteorology, with up to 5 days' lagged exposure. Results and conclusions: The adverse health effects of particulate matter on CVD and RD hospital admissions in the elderly were mainly mediated by PM10 and accumulation mode particles with lack of effects for NC100. For paediatric asthma, accumulation mode particles, NC100 and nitrogen oxides (mainly from traffic related sources) were relevant, whereas PM10 appeared to have little effect. Our results suggest that particle volume/mass from long-range transported air pollution is relevant for CVD and RD admissions in the elderly, and possibly particle numbers from traffic sources for paediatric asthma.

Genetic susceptibility to the respiratory effects of air pollution	THORAX			English	Review							BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; DIESEL EXHAUST PARTICLES; ACUTE LUNG INJURY; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE FLUID; REPEATED OZONE EXPOSURES; S-TRANSFERASE M1; OXIDATIVE STRESS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; PARTICULATE AIR	There is large variation between individuals in their response to air pollutants. This review summarises the existing evidence that genetic factors influence the mechanisms of lung injury caused by air pollutants. Genetic association studies have compared the adverse effects of air pollutants between subjects with specific genotypes in biologically relevant genes. In human studies of ozone exposure, polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes (NQO1, GSTM1, GSTP1) modify respiratory symptoms, lung function, biomarkers and risk of asthma. Inflammatory gene polymorphisms (TNF) influence the lung function response to ozone, and the effect of different levels of ozone on the development of asthma. Polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes (GSTM1, GSTP1) alter the response to combined exposure to ragweed pollen and diesel exhaust particles. Importantly, polymorphisms in an oxidative stress gene (GSTM1) have predicted patients with asthma who benefit from antioxidant supplementation in Mexico City, which has chronically high ozone exposure. Genetic linkage studies of families have not been feasible for studying the effects of air pollution in humans, but some progress has been made with pedigrees of specially bred mice, in identifying chromosomal regions linked to effects of ozone or particles. A high priority now, in addition to avoiding exposure in the most susceptible people, is to clearly identify the most effective and safe chemopreventive agents for individuals who are genetically susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution (eg, antioxidants to be taken during high ozone levels).

The use of antibiotics in infancy and subsequent changes in the intestinal bacterial flora have been discussed as risk factors for the development of asthma. However, it has been difficult to exclude the possibility that antibiotics have been given in early episodes of wheezing. As a result, there has been a risk of reverse causation. To minimize the risk of reverse causation, we have focused on the effect of antibiotics that are already administered on the neonatal ward. METHODS. In a cohort study of infants born in western Sweden in 2003, we studied the development of wheezing. The families of the infants were randomly selected and sent a questionnaire at child ages 6 and 12 months. The response rate was 68.5% to the 6-month questionnaire and 68.9% to the 12-month questionnaire. RESULTS. At 12 months, 20.2% of infants had had 1 or more episodes of wheezing, and 5.3% had had 3 or more episodes. Inhaled corticosteroids had been taken by 4.1% of the infants. Independent risk factors for wheezing disorder treated with inhaled corticosteroids were neonatal antibiotic treatment, male gender, gestational age of <37 weeks, having a mother with asthma, having a sibling with asthma or eczema, and breastfeeding for <5 months. CONCLUSIONS. Treatment with antibiotics in the neonatal period was an independent risk factor for wheezing that was treated with inhaled corticosteroids at 12 months of age. These results indirectly support the hypothesis that an alteration in the intestinal flora can increase the risk of subsequent wheezing.	[Alm, Bernt; Norvenius, S.

However, little is known about which sources of particulate matter contribute most to the adverse health effects. Identification of responsible sources would merit more effficient control. For a 6-year period ( 01 January 1999 to 31 December 2004), we examined associations between urban background PM10 in the presence of gaseous pollutants ( CO, NO2) and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease in the elderly (age >= 65), and asthma in children (age 5-18) in Copenhagen, Denmark. We further studied associations between fractions of PM10 assigned to six sources (biomass, secondary, oil, crustal, sea salt, and vehicle) and admissions during a 11/2 -year campaign. We used Poisson generalized additive time-series model adjusted for season, day of the week, public holidays, influenza epidemics, grass pollen, school holidays, and meteorology, with up to 5 days lagged air pollution exposure. We found positive associations between PM10 and the three health outcomes, with strongest associations for asthma. The PM10 effect remained robustin the presence of CO and NO2. We found different PM10 sources to be variably associated with different outcomes: crustal and secondary sources showed strongest associations with cardiovascular, biomass with respiratory, and vehicle with asthma admissions. These novel results may merit future research of potential mechanism, whereas at present, no single PM10 source can be attributed to all morbidity.

Allergic airway responses in obese mice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						airway responsiveness; eosinophil; immunoglobulin E; interleukin-13; pulmonary resistance	BODY-MASS INDEX; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; ACUTE OZONE EXPOSURE; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; PULMONARY RESPONSES; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; WEIGHT-REDUCTION; ASTHMA; INFLAMMATION	Rationale: Epidemiologic data indicate an increased incidence of asthma in the obese. Objectives: To determine whether obese mice exhibit augmented pulmonary responses after allergen sensitization and challenge. Methods: Lean, wild-type (C57BL/6), obese ob/ob, and obese db/db mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), and then challenged with aerosolized OVA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Changes in total pulmonary resistance (RL) induced by intravenous methacholine were measured by forced oscillation. Blood was collected, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and lungs were harvested for measurement of cytokine expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: OVA challenge increased baseline R-L in ob/ob, but not wild-type, mice, and airway responsiveness was greater in ob/ob than wild-type mice, regardless of the challenge. Compared with PBS, OVA challenge caused an increase in the number of BAL fluid (BALF) cells, an increase in lung Th2 cytokine expression, and an increase in serum IgE. Significantly fewer BALF cells were recovered from OVA-challenged ob/ob versus wild-type mice, whereas serum IgE levels were elevated significantly more in ob/ob versus wild-type mice. BALIF and lung Th2 cytokine expression was not different in ob/ob versus wild-type mice. Airway responsiveness was greater in db/db versus wild-type mice, regardless of the challenge, and OVA caused airway hyperresponsiveness in db/db but not wild-type mice, despite reduced BALF cells in OVA-challenged db/db versus wild-type mice. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that obesity enhances OVA-induced changes in pulmonary resistance and serum IgE and that these changes are not the result of increased Th2 type airway inflammation.

Comparative overview of indoor air quality in Antwerp, Belgium	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						indoor air quality; PM1; PM2.5; PM10; gaseous pollutants	SUSPENDED PARTICLE EXPOSURES; ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; HONG-KONG; PARTICULATE MATTER; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; INDOOR/OUTDOOR RELATIONSHIPS; ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION	This comprehensive study, a first in Belgium, aimed at characterizing the residential and school indoor air quality of subgroups that took part in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey and the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood [Masoli M, Fabian D, Holt S, Beasley R. Global Burden of Asthma, Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, University of Southampton; 2004.] questionnaire-based asthma and related illnesses studies. The principal aim was to perform a base-line study to assess the indoor air quality in Antwerp in terms of various gaseous and particulate pollutants. Secondly, it aimed to establish correlations between these pollutants investigated, the pollutant levels in the indoor and outdoor micro-environments, findings of the previous questionnaire-based studies and an epidemiological study which ran in conjunction with this study. Lastly, these results were compared and evaluated with current indoor and ambient guidelines in various countries This paper presents selected results on PM1, PM2.5 and PM 10 mass concentrations and elemental C estimates as black smoke, as well as gaseous NO, SO2, O-3 and BTEX concentrations of 18 residences and 27 schools. These are related to current guidelines of Flanders, Germany, Norway, China and Canada and evaluated with reference to selected similar studies. It was found that indoor sources such as tobacco smoking and carpets, the latter causing re-suspension of dust, are responsible for elevated indoor respirable particulate matter and place school children and residents at risk. Both PM2.5 and PM10 equalled or exceeded the current guidelines adopted by Flanders, noting that 12-h and 24-h PM2.5 were compared with an annual limit value.

CAPS Team	Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid exposure from early life does not affect atopy and asthma at age 5 years	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						asthma; allergy and immunology; birth cohort; child; eczema; omega-3 fatty acids; omega-6 fatty acids; primary prevention	CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; CHILDREN; DIETARY; ADULTS; RISK; PREVENTION; TRIAL; FISH	Background: The Childhood Asthma Prevention Study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in children with a family history of asthma in whom omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and restriction of dietary omega-6 fatty acids did not prevent asthma, eczema, or atopy at age 5 years. Objective: We sought to examine the relation of all measures of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with outcomes at age 5 years in the whole birth cohort, regardless of randomization group. Methods: Plasma fatty acids were measured at 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years. Compliance with the fatty acid supplements was estimated every 6 months. Dietary intake was assessed at 18 months by means of weighed-food record and at 3 years by means of food-frequency questionnaire. At age 5 years, 516 children were examined for wheeze and eczema (questionnaire) and atopy (skin prick tests, n = 488). Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between exposures and outcomes. Results: Plasma levels of omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids were not associated with wheeze, eczema, or atopy at age 5 years (P = .11-.96). Overall, fatty acid exposure, measured as plasma levels, dietary intake, and compliance with supplements, was not associated with any respiratory or allergic outcomes (P =.35-.59). Conclusion: This observational analysis of the cohort, using the full range of observed variation in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid exposure, supports the negative findings of the randomized controlled trial. Clinical implications: Modification of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in early childhood is not helpful in preventing atopy and asthma.

Health effects of airborne exposures from concentrated animal feeding operations	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						air quality; asthma; biological agents; endotoxin; inflammation; odor; poultry; swine	SWINE CONFINEMENT BUILDINGS; IN-HOUSE DUST; ENDOTOXIN EXPOSURE; LUNG-FUNCTION; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; HAY-FEVER; ENVIRONMENTAL ENDOTOXIN; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; FARMERS CHILDREN	Toxic gases, vapors, and particles are emitted from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) into the general environment. These include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, malodorous vapors, and particles contaminated with a wide range of microorganisms. Little is known about the health risks of exposure to these agents for people living in the surrounding areas. Malodor is one of the predominant concerns, and there is evidence that psychophysiologic changes may occur as a result of exposure to malodorous compounds. There is a paucity of data regarding community adverse health effects related to low-level gas and particulate emissions. Most information comes from studies among workers in CAFO installations. Research over the last decades has shown that microbial exposures, especially endotoxin exposure, are related to deleterious respiratory health effects, of which cross-shift lung function decline and accelerated decline over time are the most pronounced effects. Studies in naive subjects and workers have shown respiratory inflammatory responses related to the microbial load. This working group, which was part of the Conference on Environmental Health Impacts of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations: Anticipating Hazards-Searching for Solutions, concluded that there is a great need to evaluate health effects from exposures to the toxic gases, vapors, and particles emitted into the general environment by CAFOs. Research should focus not only on nuisance and odors but also on potential health effects from microbial exposures, concentrating on susceptible subgroups, especially asthmatic children and the elderly, since these exposures have been shown to be related to respiratory health effects among workers in CAFOs.

Aerosolized red-tide toxins (brevetoxins) and asthma	CHEST			English	Article						asthma; brevetoxins; harmful algal blooms; Karenia brevis; red tides; sensitive populations; spirometry	AIR-POLLUTION; MARINE AEROSOL; HUMAN EXPOSURE; FLORIDA; POPULATION; SHELLFISH; EVENTS; BREVIS; HEALTH	Background: With the increasing incidence of asthma, there is increasing concern over environmental exposures that may trigger asthma exacerbations. Blooms of the marine microalgae, Karenia brevis, cause red titles (or harmful algal blooms) annually throughout the Gulf of Mexico. K brevis produces higlily potent natural polyether toxins, called brevetoxins, which are sodium channel blockers, and possibly histamine activators. In experimental animals, brevetoxins cause significant bronchoconstriction. In humans, a significant increase in self-reported respiratory symptoms has been described after recreational and occupational exposures to Florida red-tide aerosols, particularly among individuals with asthma. Methods: Before and after 1 h spent on beaches with and without an active K brevis red-tide exposure, 97 persons 12 years of age with physician-diagnosed asthma were evaluated by questionnaire and spirometry. Concomitant environmental monitoring, water and air sampling, and personal monitoring for brevetoxins were performed. Results: Participants were significantly more likely to report respiratory symptoms after K brevis red-tide aerosol exposure than before exposure. Participants demonstrated small, but statistically significant, decreases in FEV1, midexpiratory phase of forced expiratory, flow, and peak expiratory flow after exposure, particularly among those participants regularly using asthma medications. No significant differences were detected when there was no Florida red tide (ie, during nonexposure periods). Conclusions: This study demonstrated objectively measurable adverse changes in lung function from exposure to aerosolized Florida red-tide toxins in asthmatic subjects, particularly among those requiring regular therapy with asthma medications. Future studies will assess these susceptible subpopulations in more deptb,as well as the possible long-term effects of these toxins.

Influence of dog ownership and high endotoxin on wheezing and atopy during infancy	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						endotoxin; birth cohort; wheeze; house dust; pet ownership	HOUSE-DUST ENDOTOXIN; HAY-FEVER; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE; DECREASED PREVALENCE; ASTHMATIC-CHILDREN; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; CHILDHOOD ISAAC; TOBACCO-SMOKE; BIRTH COHORT	Background: Increased exposure to microbial products early in life may protect from development of atopic disorders in childhood. Few studies have examined the relationship of endotoxin exposure and pet ownership on atopy and wheezing during infancy. Objective: Evaluate relationships among high endotoxin exposure, pet ownership, atopy, and wheezing in high-risk infants. Methods: Infants (n = 532; mean age, 12.5 +/- 0.8 months) with at least 1 parent with confirmed atopy were recruited. A complete medical history and skin prick testing to foods and aeroallergens were performed at age 1 year. House dust samples were analyzed for endotoxin. Results: Prevalences of wheezing were not independently associated with dog or cat ownership or endotoxin levels. Percutaneous reactivity to at least 1 allergen was observed in 28.6% of infants. Univariate analyses showed significant associations of any wheezing, recurrent wheezing, and recurrent wheezing with an event with daycare attendance, number of siblings, respiratory infections, maternal smoking, and history of parental asthma. Logistic regression adjusting for the latter variables showed that recurrent wheezing (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) as well as 2 other wheeze outcomes were significantly reduced in homes with high endotoxin exposure in the presence of 2 or more dogs. Conclusion: Pet ownership or endotoxin did not independently modify aeroallergen sensitization or wheezing during infancy. However, high endotoxin exposure in the presence of multiple dogs was associated with reduced wheezing in infants. Clinical implications: A home environment with many dogs and high levels of endotoxin may be conducive to reduced wheezing in infancy.

In this article, an overview of the epidemiological evidence is presented with a discussion of a number of methodological issues important in this area of study. Literature searches were conducted using the MEDLINE database from 1966 through to August 2005 to identify articles that explored a personal history of allergic disorders as a risk factor for cancer. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions between allergy and cancer at many sites because of insufficient evidence or a lack of consistency both within and among studies completed to date, strong inverse associations have been reported for pancreatic cancer and glioma, whereas lung cancer was positively associated with asthma. Additional studies are needed to confirm these finding and to address the limitations of previous studies, including the validity and reliability of exposure measures and control for confounding. Further, large prospective studies using cancer incidence would be particularly useful, including studies using biological markers of allergic status to reduce potential misclassification and to confirm the results of previous studies based on self-report. There is also a need for further basic research to clarify a potential mechanism, should an association exist. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We examined the role of H1R in allergic inflammation in vivo using a murine asthma model. Allergen-stimulated splenic T cells from sensitized H1R(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced Th2 cytokine production. Despite this Th2 bias, allergen-challenged H1R(-/-) mice exhibited diminished lung Th2 cytokine mRNA levels, airway inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Restoration of pulmonary Th2 cytokines in H1R(-/-) mice by intranasal IL-4 or IL-13 restored inflammatory lung responses and AHR Further investigation revealed that histamine acts as a T cell chemotactic factor and defective T cell trafficking was responsible for the absence of lung inflammation. Cultured T cells migrated in response to histamine in vitro, but this was ablated by blockade of H1R but not H2R In vivo, allergen-specific WT but not H1R(-/-) CD4(+) T cells were recruited to the lungs of naive recipients following inhaled allergen challenge.

Pupils (5-14 years) in eight schools received a questionnaire, 1014 participated (68%). Settled dust was collected on ALK-filters and analyzed for allergens from cat (Fel d 1), dog (Can f 1), horse (Equ cx), house dust mites (Der p 1, Der f 1), and cockroach (Bla g 1) by ELISA. In total, 6.8% reported cat allergy, 4.8% dog allergy, 7.7% doctor's diagnosed asthma and 5.9% current asthma, and 7.8% reported wheeze. Current asthma was less common among those consuming more fresh milk (P < 0.05) and fish (P < 0.01). Poly-unsaturated fatty acids was associated with more wheeze (P < 0.05), olive oil was associated with less doctors' diagnosed asthma (P < 0.05). Totally, 74% of the classrooms had mean CO2 < 1000 ppm. The median concentration per gram dust was 860 ng/g Fel d 1, 750 ng/g Can f 1 and 954 U/g Equ cx. Horse allergen was associated with more wheeze (P < 0.05), daytime breathlessness (P < 0.05), current asthma (P < 0.05) and atopic sensitization (P < 0.05). Dog allergen was associated with wheeze (P < 0.05) and daytime breathlessness (P < 0.05). The associations between allergens and respiratory symptoms were more pronounced among those consuming margarine, not consuming butter, and with a low intake of milk. In conclusion, cat, dog and horse allergens in schools could be a risk factor for asthma and atopic sensitization, and dietary factors may interact with the allergen exposure.

MICE; ASTHMA; TLR4	Rapid and selective recruitment of neutrophils into the airspace in response to LPS facilitates the clearance of bacterial pathogens. However, neutrophil infiltration can also participate in the development and progression of environmental airway disease. Previous data have revealed that Toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) is required for neutrophil recruitment to the lung after either inhaled or systemically administrated LPS from Escherichia coli. Although many cell types express tlr4, endothelial cell expression of tlr4 is specifically required to sequester neutrophils in the lung in response to systemic endotoxin. To identify the cell types requiring trl4 expression for neutrophil recruitment after inhaled LPS, we generated chimeric mice separately expressing tlr4 on either hematopoietic cells or on structural lung cells. Neutrophil recruitment into the airspace was completely restored in tlr4-deficient mice receiving wild-type bone marrow. By contrast, wild-type animals receiving tlr4-deficient marrow had dramatically reduced neutrophil recruitment. Moreover, adoptive transfer of wild-type alveolar macrophages also restored the ability of tlr4-deficient recipient mice to recruit neutrophils to the lung. These data demonstrate the critical role of hematopoietic cells and alveolar macrophages in initiating LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment from the vascular space to the airspace.

Furthermore, it is recognized that the etiology of many lung diseases involves a complex interplay between genetic background and exposure to multiple environmental stimuli, and understanding the mechanisms through which genes and environment interact represents a major challenge for pulmonary researchers. We discuss experimental approaches and challenges that must be overcome to identify disease genes for asthma, COPD and chronic bronchitis, and occupational lung diseases. In particular, common polymorphisms in CD14, glutathione S-transferase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha have been found to be important in gene-environment interaction and asthma pathogenesis. An understanding of gene-environment interactions in complex lung diseases is essential to the development of new strategies for lung disease prevention and treatment.

Although Asian countries used to have lower prevalence rates of allergic disease than Western countries, this prevalence is increasing in several Asian countries. To determine whether the prevalence of childhood asthma is changing in Korean adolescents, we compared findings from nationwide cross-sectional surveys in 1995 and 2000 on populations of middle-school children using the Korean version of the ISAAC questionnaire. Methods We developed Korean versions of the ISAAC written (WQ) and video (AVQ) questionnaires for allergic diseases. In 1995, the enrolled population consisted of 15 481 children, ages 12-15, and encompassing all three grades in middle school, selected from 34 schools across the nation; the response rate was 97.3%. In 2000, 15 894 children were selected from 31 of the same schools, and the response rate was 96.4%. The SAS system version 8.0 was utilized for all statistical analyses. Results The WQ showed that the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of wheeze did not change from 1995 to 2000. While the 12-month prevalence rates of sleep disturbed by wheezing and night cough increased, the rates of severe attack of wheezing and exercise-induced wheeze did not change, over this period of time. The lifetime prevalence of asthma diagnosis, however, increased significantly, from 2.7% in 1995 to 5.3% in 2000, as did the 12-month prevalence of asthma treatment, from 1.0% in 1995 to 1.9% in 2000. The AVQ also showed increases in the lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of wheeze at rest, exercise-induced wheeze, nocturnal wheeze, nocturnal cough, and severe wheeze over this period of time. These were especially because of significant increases in the Provincial cities of Korea. Interestingly, the 12-month prevalence of wheeze was consistently high in Cheju with low air pollution indices, whereas this rate was low in Ulsan and Ansan with very high air pollution indices. Risk factor analysis showed that body mass index (BMI), passive smoking, and living with a dog or cat, but not air pollution, were associated with higher risk of wheeze. Conclusions In the 5-year period from 1995 to 2000, the prevalence of asthma symptoms has increased in Korean adolescents, much of it because of increases in Provincial Centers. BMI, passive smoking, and living with a dog or cat are important risk factors. Environmental factors other than air pollution may be associated with increases in asthma, especially in Provincial Centers.

To evaluate the frequency of ACD in children, we analysed patch test results collected by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology between 1995 and 2002. Data of 285 children (6-12 year) and 2175 adolescent patients (13-18 year) were analysed to determine the frequency of sensitization to the 30 most common contact allergens, adjusting for age and sex. As control group, we defined adult patients (60-66 year, n = 7904). The top allergens in children were thimerosal, gentamicin sulphate, nickel-II-sulphate, ammoniated mercury, cobalt-II-chloride, fragrance mix, bufexamac, Compositae mix, propylene glycol and turpentine. The overall proportion of sensitized patients according to the patch test results was 52.6% in the children group compared to 49.7% in the adolescent group. These findings were similar in the adult group at 52.2%. The detailed analysis regarding sex, occupation, atopy, site of eczema and age showed distinct patterns in each group indicating age-specific exposures. Atopy-related diseases were more common in children compared to adults. On the basis of the data of this study, the relationship between atopy and the risk of development of ACD, at least in children, needs further investigation.

Adequate information is not available to the bioaerosol researchers regarding the choice of single versus multiple sampling stations for the monitoring of both viable and non-viable airborne fungi. There is no long-term study estimating the ratios of viable and non-viable fungi in the air and earlier studies did not focus on the fractions of airborne allergenic fungi with respect to the total airborne fungal load. To fill these knowledge gaps, volumetric paired assessments of airborne viable and non-viable fungi were performed in five outdoor sampling stations during two consecutive years in a rural agricultural area of India. Samples were collected at 10-day intervals by the Burkard Personal Slide Sampler and the Andersen Two-Stage Viable Sampler. The data on the concentrations of total and individual fungal types from five stations and 2 different years were analyzed and compared by statistical methods. The allergenicity of the prevalent airborne viable fungi was estimated by the skin-prick tests of > 100 rural allergy patients using the antigenic fungal extracts from isolates collected with the Andersen sampler. The ranges of total fungal spore concentration were 82-2365 spores per cubic meter of air (spores/m(3)) in the first sampling year and 156-2022 spores/m(3) in the second sampling year. The concentration ranges of viable fungi were 72-1796 colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m(3)) in the first sampling year and 155-1256 CFU/m(3) in the second sampling year. No statistically significant difference was observed between the total spore data of the 2 years, however, the data between five stations showed a significant difference (P<0.0001). No statistically significant difference existed between stations and years with respect to the concentration of viable fungi. When the data of individual allergenic fungal concentrations were compared between stations and years, no statistically significant difference was observed in all cases except for Aspergillus japonicus and Rhizopus nigricans, which showed significant difference in case of stations and years, respectively. The ratios between the total fungal spores collected by the Burkard sampler and the viable fungi collected by the Andersen sampler from all sampling stations ranged between 0.29 and 7.61. The antigenic extracts of eight prevalent viable airborne fungi (A. flavus, A. japonicus, A. fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Curvularia pallescens, Fusarium roseum, and R. nigricans) demonstrated > 60% positive reactions in the skin prick test. These selected allergenic fungi collectively represented 31.7-63.2% of the total airborne viable fungi in different stations. The study concluded that: (i) a rich fungal airspora existed in the rural study area, (ii) to achieve representative information on the total airborne fungal spores of an area, the monitoring in multiple sampling stations is preferable over a single sampling station; for viable fungi, however, one station can be considered, (iii) the percentage of airborne fungal viability is higher in rural agricultural areas, and (iv) approximately 52% of the viable airborne fungi in the rural study area were allergenic.

To define the role of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fcis an element ofRI) in the development of AHR, mice with a disruption of the a subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fcis an element ofRI(-/-)) were exposed on 10 consecutive days to nebulized OVA. Forty-eight hours after the last nebulization, airway responsiveness was monitored by the contractile response of tracheal smooth muscle to electrical field. stimulation (EFS). After the 10-day OVA challenge protocol, wild-type mice demonstrated increased responsiveness to EFS, whereas similarly challenged Fcis an element ofRI(-/-) mice showed a low response to EFS, similar to nonexposed animals. Further, allergen-challenged Fcis an element ofRI(-/-) mice showed less airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and lower levels of IL-13 in lung homogenates compared with the controls. IL-13-deficient mice failed to develop an increased response to EFS or goblet cell hyperplasia after the 10-day OVA challenge. We transferred bone marrow-derived mast cells from wild-type mice to Fcis an element ofRI(-/-) mice 1 day before initiating the challenge protocol. After the 10-day OVA challenge, recipient Fcis an element ofRI(-/-) mice demonstrated EFS-induced responses similar to those of challenged wild-type mice. Transferred mast cells could be detected in tracheal preparations. These results show that Fcis an element ofRI is important for the development of AHR after an aerosolized allergen sensitization protocol and that this effect is mediated through Fcis an element ofRI on mast cells and production of IL-13 in the lung.

This review examines the evidence for a potential role of changing dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the development, treatment and prevention of allergic diseases. Recent findings Although it is difficult to determine the contribution of altered (decreased) dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to the recent rise in the incidence of allergic disease, there is growing evidence that these nutrients have antiinflammatory properties and may modulate immune responses. These fatty acids have few side effects, and may be of some benefit in established allergic diseases (such as asthma and atopic dermatitis), although these effects are not strong. Because of this limited efficacy in established disease, the focus has shifted to the potential benefits of these immune modulators in earlier life for disease prevention. Two recent preliminary reports in infants suggest that dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements in pregnancy or in the early postnatal period could have immunomodulatory properties and associated clinical effects, although more studies are now needed. Novel synthetic polyunsaturated fatty acids with more potent and selective antiinflammatory effects may also provide safe therapeutic and preventive strategies in the future. Summary Dietary factors are important but still under-explored candidates in the search for environmental strategies to reduce the enormous impact of allergic diseases in modernized societies. There is an ongoing need for further research into the role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in allergic disease, particularly in early life before atopy is established.

We examined the trend of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema prevalence in school children aged 6-7 years in Hong Kong from 1995 to 2001 using standardized ISAAC methodology. There were 4448 and 3618 children participating in 2001 and 1995, respectively. The prevalence of life-time rhinitis (42.4% vs. 38.9%, p < 0.01), current rhinitis (37.4% vs. 35.1%, p < 0.03), current rhinoconjunctivitis (17.2 vs. 13.6 %, p < 0.01) and life-time eczema (30.7% vs. 28.1%, p = 0.01) increased significantly. There was no significant change in prevalence of life-time asthma, life-time wheeze and current wheeze albeit a significant increase in severe asthma symptoms. We investigated a number of potential risk factors including sex, family history of atopy, sibship size, birth weight, respiratory tract infections, pet ownership and exposure to tobacco smoke. However, the increases in prevalence of rhinitis and eczema could not be entirely explained by the change of prevalence of these risk factors. The odds ratio OR for the study period remained significantly associated with current rhinitis (OR 1.31, 95% confidence intervals CI 1.17-1.46), current rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 1.63, 95% Cl 1.41-1.87) and life-time eczema (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.45) after adjustment for these confounding variables using logistic regression model. Further study is warranted to elucidate the factors contributing to the observable change in the prevalence of rhinitis in our population.

We recruited 26 Hispanic children with mild asthma in a Los Angeles community with high VOC levels near major freeways and trucking routes. Two dropped out, three had invalid peak expiratory flow (PEF) or breath VOC data, leaving 21. Children filled out symptom diaries and performed PEF maneuvers daily, November 1999 January 2000. We aimed to collect breath VOC samples on asthma episode and baseline symptom-free days, but six subjects only gave samples on symptom-free days. We analyzed 106 breath samples by GC-MS. Eight VOCs were quanti. able in >75% of breath samples (benzene, methylene chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, and p-dichlorobenzene). Generalized estimating equation and mixed linear regression models for VOC exposure-response relationships controlled for temperature and respiratory infections. We found marginally positive associations between bothersome or more severe asthma symptoms and same day breath concentrations of benzene [odds ratio ( OR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80, 5.11] but not other breath VOCs. Ambient petroleum-related VOCs measured on the same person-days as breath VOCs showed notably stronger associations with symptoms, including toluene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, and benzene (OR 5.93, 95% CI 1.64, 21.4). On breath sample days, symptoms were also associated with 1-h ambient NO2, OR 8.13 (1.52, 43.4), and SO2, OR 2.36 (1.16, 4.81). Consistent inverse relationships were found between evening PEF and the same ambient VOCs, NO2, and SO2. There were no associations with O-3. Given the high traffic density of the region, stronger associations for ambient than for breath VOCs suggest that ambient VOC measurements were better markers for daily exposure to combustion-related compounds thought to be causally related to acute asthma. Alternatively, the low sample size of symptom responses (5-21 responses per 108 breath samples) may have led to the nonsignificant results for breath VOCs.

A C-to-T polymorphism at position -159 of CD14 was associated with serum total IgE level in Caucasians but not in Japanese subjects. The objective of this study is to determine whether this polymorphic marker is associated with atopy and asthma phenotypes in Chinese children. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to characterize CD14/-159 genotypes. Microparticle immunoassay was used to measure serum total IgE level; fluorescent enzyme immunoassay was performed to measure serum concentrations of specific IgE to aeroallergens; and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14). Lung function in asthmatics was assessed by spirometry. Two hundred and fifty-eight patients and 92 control children were recruited. Their mean serum total IgE concentrations were 331 and 74 kIU/l, respectively (p < 0.0001). Atopy, defined as the presence of at least one allergen-specific IgE in serum, was found in 220 (85%) patients and in 41 (45%) controls (p < 0.0001). Serum sCD14 levels were significantly associated with CD14/-159 genotypes (p = 0.004). Atopic subjects with CC genotype in CD14/-159 had the highest serum total IgE levels compared with CT and TT genotypes, with the respective mean values being 661, 427 and 380 kIU/l (p = 0.015). Similarly, a higher proportion of subjects with CC genotype had increased serum total IgE concentration (p = 0.039). This polymorphic marker was not associated with asthma or aeroallergen sensitization in our cohort. Our results suggest that the C-159T of CD14 was associated with serum total IgE concentration in atopic Chinese children.

Surviving subjects also completed a morbidity questionnaire. Mortality was significantly higher in both exposed and control subjects compared with the Australian population. The major cause was mortality from smoking-related diseases. Mortality was also significantly increased in exposed subjects for a number of conditions that do not appear to be the result of smoking patterns. Compared with the general Australian population, mortality over the total study period was increased for asthma [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 3.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-7.10] and for diabetes (SMR = 3.57; 95% CI, 1.16-8.32 for subjects working < 5 years). Mortality from pancreatic cancer was more frequent in subjects exposed to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane (SMR = 5.27; 95% CI, 1.09-15.40 for subjects working < 3 years). Compared with the control population, mortality from leukemia was increased in subjects working with more modern chemicals (standardized incidence ratio = 20.90; 95% CI, 1.54-284.41 for myeloid leukemia in the highest exposure group). There was also an increase in self-reported chronic illness and asthma, and lower neuropsychologic functioning scores among surviving exposed subjects when compared with controls. Diabetes was reported more commonly by subjects reporting occupational use of herbicides. These findings lend weight to other studies suggesting an association between adverse health effects and exposure to pesticides.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dust mite allergen in beds of US homes and to identify predictors of dust mite allergen concentration. Methods: Data were obtained from the first National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing, a cross-sectional survey of 831 permanently occupied noninstitutional housing units that permitted resident children. Dust mite allergen concentration (Der f 1 plus Der p 1) was determined from a dust sample collected from a bed. The percentages of homes with concentrations at or greater than detection, 2.0 mug/g bed dust, and 10.0 mug/g bed dust were estimated. Independent predictors of allergen concentration were assessed with multivariable linear regression. Results: The percentages of US homes with dust mite allergen concentrations at or greater than detection, 2.0 mug/g, and 10.0 mug/g were 84.2% (SE, 1.73), 46.2% (SE, 2.0), and 24.2% (SE, 2.1), respectively. Independent predictors of higher levels were older homes, non-West census regions, single-family homes, no resident children, lower household income, heating sources other than forced air, musty or mildew odor, and higher bedroom humidity. Conclusion: Most US homes have detectable levels of dust mite allergen in a bed. Levels previously associated with allergic sensitization and asthma are common in US bedrooms. Predictors can be used to identify conditions under which homes are more likely to have increased dust mite allergen levels.

Previous studies have investigated reported hypersensitivity to electricity in selected groups recruited from workplaces or outpatient clinics. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of self-reported hypersensitivity to electric or magnetic fields in the general population and to describe characteristics of the group reporting such hypersensitivity with regard to demographics, other complaints, hypersensitivities, and traditional allergies. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in 1997 among 15 000 men and women between 19 and 80 years of age in Stockholm County. The response rate was 73%. Results One and a half percent of the respondents reported hypersensitivity to electric or magnetic fields. Prevalence was highest among women and in the 60- to 69-year age group. The hypersensitive group reported all symptoms, allergies, and other types of hypersensitivities included in the survey (as well as being disturbed by various factors in the: home) to a significantly greater extent than the rest of the respondents. No specific symptom profile set off the hypersensitive group from the rest of the respondents. Conclusions The results should be interpreted with caution. But they suggest that there is widespread concern among the general population about risks to health posed by electric and magnetic fields. More research is warranted to explore ill health among people reporting hypersensitivity to electric or magnetic fields.

The prevalence of diisocyanate asthma among exposed workers is estimated to range from 5% to 15%. Routes of exposure include the respiratory tract and skin. Workplace exposures are difficult to quantify and control, and there is no simple diagnostic test for the disease. This review considers recent concepts in exposure, clinical aspects and pathogenesis of the disease. The pathogenesis of diisocyanate asthma remains unclear, with evidence supporting both immunological and noninummological mechanisms. Knowledge of the chemical reactivity of diisocyanates, the target biomolecules, and the cellular sites of reaction are fundamental to understanding diisocyanate toxicity and disease. Recent findings of chemical interactions with biological nucleophiles will be described. The importance of diisocyanate-adducted biomolecules will be emphasized and their potential contributions: to pathogenesis discussed. It is anticipated that greater understanding of the immunopathogenesis of diisocyanate asthma, including the initial cell/diisocyanate reactions, should lead to clinically useful markers of exposure and early disease.

This study describes the timecourse of the incidence of work-related symptoms, skin reactivity and occupational rhinoconjunctivitis (RC) and asthma (OA); and assesses the predictive value of skin testing and RC symptoms in apprentices exposed to laboratory animals, in a 3-4-yr programme. Four-hundred and seventeen apprentices at five institutions were assessed prospectively with questionnaire, skin-testing with animal-derived allergens, spirometry and airway responsiveness (n = 373). Depending on the school, students were seen 8 (n = 136), 20 (n = 345), 32 (n = 355) and 44 (n = 98) months after starting the programme. At all visits, the incidence was greater for work-related RC symptoms followed in order by skin reactivity, occupational RC, and, almost equally, OA and work-related respiratory symptoms. The incidence-density figures were comparable for each followup period and for most indices up to 32 months after entry into the study and then tended to decrease. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of skin reactivity to work-related allergens for the development of work-related RC and respiratory symptoms were 30% and 9.0%, respectively, while the PPVs of work-related RC for the development of OA was 11.4%. Sensitization, symptoms and diseases occur maximally in the first 2-3 yrs after starting exposure to laboratory animals. Skin reactivity to work-related allergens and rhinoconjuctivitis symptoms have low positive predictive values.

Generalized additive models were used to regress time series of daily numbers of patients consulting for allergic rhinitis against 1992-1994 measures of air pollution, after control for possible confounders and adjustment for overdispersion and serial correlation. In children, a 10th-90th percentile increase in sulfur dioxide (SO(3)) levels 4 days prior to consultation (13-31 mug/m(3)) was associated with a 24.5% increase in consultations (95% confidence interval: 14.6, 35.2; p < 0.00001); a 10th-90th percentile increase in averaged ozone (O(3)) concentrations on the day of consultation and the preceding 3 days (6-29 parts per billion) was associated with a 37.6% rise (95% confidence interval: 23,3, 53.5; p < 0,00001). For adults, smaller effect sizes were observed for SO(3) and O(3). The association with SO(3) remained highly significant in the presence of other pollutants. This study suggests that air pollution worsens allergic rhinitis symptoms, leading to substantial increases in consultations. SO(3) and O(3) seem particularly responsible, and both seem to contribute independently.

Residential exposures are recognized risk factors for childhood asthma, but the relative contribution of specific risk factors and the overall contribution of housing to asthma in US children is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and estimate the population attributable risk of residential exposures for doctor-diagnosed asthma for US children. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Survey participants were 8257 children who were <6 years old and who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey of the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States. The main outcome measure was doctor-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parent. Results. Six percent of children had doctor-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma was higher among boys (6.7%) than girls (5.1%) and was higher among black children (8.9%) than white children (5.2%). Risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma included a family history of atopy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 3.1), child's history of allergy to a pet (OR: 24.2; 95% CI: 8.4, 69.5), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.6), use of a gas stove or oven for heat (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.02-3.2), and presence of a dog in the household (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.3). The population attributable risk of <greater than or equal to>1 residential exposure for doctor-diagnosed asthma in US children <6 years old was 39.2%, or an estimated 533 000 excess cases, whereas having a family history of atopy accounted for 300 000. The attributable cost of asthma as a result of residential exposures for children <6 years old was $402 million (95% CI: $296-$507 million) annually. Conclusions. The elimination of identified residential risk factors, if causally associated with asthma, would result in a 39% decline in doctor-diagnosed asthma among US children <6 years old.

Sauna bathing does not influence fertility and is safe during the uncomplicated pregnancies of healthy women. Some studies have suggested that long-term sauna bathing may help lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension and improve the left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, but additional data are needed to confirm these findings. The transient improvements in pulmonary function that occur in the sauna may provide some relief to patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis. Sauna bathing may also alleviate pain and improve joint mobility in patients with rheumatic disease. Although sauna bathing does not cause drying of the skin-and may even benefit patients with psoriasis-sweating may increase itching in patients with atopic dermatitis. Contraindications to sauna bathing include unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction, and severe aortic stenosis. Sauna bathing is safe, however, for most people with coronary heart disease with stable angina pectoris or old myocardial infarction. Very few acute myocardial infarctions and sudden deaths occur in saunas, but alcohol consumption during sauna bathing increases the risk of hypotension, arrhythmia, and sudden death, and should be avoided.

It is still unknown how a number of factors, apart from airway inflammation, can influence NO levels. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a nitrate-rich meal on ENO and NNO. Sixteen healthy subjects were observed during 1 week on normal diet before a nitrate-restricted diet was introduced in the next. On day 3 of the second week they were made to ingest a nitrate rich meal. ENO, NNO, plasma nitrate and plasma L-arginine were followed before the meal and afterwards for 3 h. ENO and NNO as well as plasma nitrate and plasma L-arginine were significantly elevated after the nitrate-rich meal. The median maximal increase of ENO and NNO was 47% and 13% respectively. We found a moderate but significant correlation between the rise in plasma nitrate and ENO (r(s)=0.57, P=0.027) but none between plasma nitrate and NNO (r(s)=-0.02, P=0.95). As nitrate in the diet seems to substantially influence the levels of ENO it is important either to restrictor register the intake of nitrate-rich food prior to measuring ENO.

Due to its unique (1 --> 3)-beta linkage it binds to specific receptors on phagocytosing cells and induces changes in their metabolism. Under realistic environmental concentrations, available data suggest that these changes express themselves as alterations of the defense mechanisms to other agents. Inhalation of (I --> 3)-beta -D-glucan in humans causes symptoms from the upper respiratory tract and induction of cytokines in blood monocytes. (1 --> 3)-beta -D-glucan can be used as a marker of mould biomass in field studies. Relationships between the amount of (1 --> 3)-beta -D-glucan and the extent of symptoms as well as lung function changes and inflammatory markers have been described. In view of the mechanisms involved in the normal development of the immune system, children seem to be a particular group at risk due to (I --> 3)-beta -D-glucan exposure.

There is, however, limited information on the comparative effectiveness of the two classes of drugs, as well as the relative potencies of the antileukotriene agents. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to provide data on the above issues. Methods: We performed a random-order, blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial in 10 patients with EIA. Each subject received standard single doses of salmeterol, montelukast, zafirlukast, zileuton, and placebo on separate days. The participants performed 4 minutes of cycle ergometry while breathing frigid air 1, 4, 8, and 12 hours after administration of the test agents. The primary endpoint was the extent of the decrement in the FEV1 10 minutes after exertion. Results: With placebo, symptomatic airway narrowing developed at all times (mean +/- SE decrease in FEV1 ranged between 21% +/- 5% and 26% +/- 5%). Salmeterol acted quickly and significantly blunted the obstructive response for 12 hours (Delta FEV1 first hour: 8% +/- 3%; Delta FEV1 twelfth hour: 8% +/- 3%; P < .0001 vs placebo and P = .72 vs time). The leukotriene-modifying agents produced effects within 1 hour of ingestion. Like salmeterol, montelukast and zafirlukast also offered long-lasting protection, and there were no significant differences between them (montelukast Delta FEV1 twelfth hour: 9% +/- 4%; zafirlukast Delta FEV1 twelfth hour: 11% +/- 2%; P = .75) or the beta(2)-agonist (montelukast vs salmeterol: P = .72; zafirlukast vs salmeterol: P = .48). Zileuton provided equivalent prophylaxis for the first 4 hours (Delta FEV1 fourth hour: 11% +/- 2%); however, by 8 hours, it was less efficacious than all of the other active compounds, and by 12 hours it did not differ from placebo (Delta FEV1 twelfth hour: 19% +/- 4%; P = .33). Conclusions: Single doses of the currently available leukotriene receptor antagonists provide prompt effective and persistent defense against EIA that equals that seen with a long-acting beta(2)-agonist. The synthesis inhibitor zileuton affords a comparable magnitude of prophylaxis but has a considerably shorter duration of action.

Some of these products additionally act as autocrine growth factors. Increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells have been observed in several smoking-associated pediatric lung disorders such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, sudden infant death syndrome, and asthma. Disturbed pulmonary neuroendocrine function has been implicated in the etiology of this disease complex. One of the most common smoking-associated lung cancer types, small cell lung carcinoma, expresses phenotypic and functional features of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. We, as well as others, have shown that the release of the autocrine growth factors 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and mammalian bombesisn/gastrin releasing peptide (MB/GRP) by cell lines derived from human small cell lung carcinoma or fetal hamster pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are regulated by a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor comprised of alpha(7) subunits. In radio-receptor assays, nicotine and the nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamines N'-nictrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) bound with high affinity to this receptor with affinitites NNK > nicotine > NNN. Binding of nicotine or NNK to the alpha(7) receptor resulted in calcium influx and overexpression and activation of the serine-threonine protein kinase Raf-1. In turn, this event lead to overexpression and activation of the mitogen activated (MAP) kinases extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and stimulation of DNA synthesis accompanied by an increase in cell numbers in fetal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and small cell carcinoma cells. Exposure of fetal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells for 6 days to NNK caused a prominant up-regulation of Raf-1. Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to nicotine and NNK in pregnant women who smoke may up-regulate the alpha(7) nicotinic receptor as well as components of its associated mitogenic signal transduction pathway, thus increasing the susceptibilities of the infants for the development of pediatric lung disorders. Similarly, up-regulation of one or several components of this nicotinic receptor pathway in smokers may be an important factor for the development of small cell lung carcinoma.

Real-life compliance and persistence among users of subcutaneous and sublingual allergen immunotherapy	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Allergic rhinitis; specific allergen immunotherapy; subcutaneous; sublingual; subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy; sublingual allergen immunotherapy; persistence; compliance; adherence; cost	TERM CLINICAL-EFFICACY; QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; SLIT FORMULATION; EASY PROJECT; RHINITIS; ADHERENCE; ASTHMA; MEDICATION; CHILDREN; IMPACT	Background: Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) are safe and effective treatments of allergic rhinitis, but high levels of compliance and persistence are crucial to achieving the desired clinical effects. Objective: Our objective was to assess levels and predictors of compliance and persistence among grass pollen, tree pollen, and house dust mite immunotherapy users in real life and to estimate the costs of premature discontinuation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a community pharmacy database from The Netherlands containing data from 6486 patients starting immunotherapy for 1 or more of the allergens of interest between 1994 and 2009. Two thousand seven hundred ninety-six patients received SCIT, and 3690 received SLIT. Time to treatment discontinuation was analyzed and included Cox proportional hazard models with time-dependent covariates, where appropriate. Results: Overall, only 18% of users reached the minimally required duration of treatment of 3 years (SCIT, 23%; SLIT, 7%). Median durations for SCIT and SLIT users were 1.7 and 0.6 years, respectively (P < .001). Other independent predictors of premature discontinuation were prescriber, with patients of general practitioners demonstrating longer persistence than those of allergologists and other medical specialists; single-allergen immunotherapy, lower socioeconomic status; and younger age. Of the persistent patients, 56% were never late in picking up their medication from the pharmacy. Direct medication costs per nonpersistent patient discontinuing in the third year of treatment were (sic)3800, an amount that was largely misspent. Conclusion: Real-life persistence is better in SCIT users than in SLIT users, although it is low overall. There is an urgent need for further identification of potential barriers and measures that will enhance persistence and compliance.	[Kiel, Menno A.; Al, Maiwenn J.; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

Insights into the initiation of type 2 immune responses	IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						allergens; interleukin-25; interleukin-33; innate lymphoid cells; nuocytes; T helper type 2 cells; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; type 2 responses	THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; INFLAMMATORY DENDRITIC CELLS; DUST-MITE ALLERGEN; CD4(+) T-CELLS; CYTOKINE-DEPENDENT IMMUNITY; HUMAN EPITHELIAL-CELLS; IN-VITRO DEVELOPMENT; NALP3 INFLAMMASOME; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; IL-4 PRODUCTION	Type 2 immune responses, characterized by the differentiation of CD4(+) T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and the production of the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, are associated with parasitic helminth infections and inflammatory conditions such as asthma and allergies. Until recently the initiating factors associated with type 2 responses had been poorly understood. This review addresses the recent advances in identifying the diverse range of antigens/allergens associated with type 2 responses and the function, expression and sources of type-2-initiating cytokines (thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25 and IL-33). We also discuss the latest findings regarding innate lymphoid cells, such as nuocytes, as early sources of type 2 cytokines and their importance in protective immunity to helminth infections. These developments represent major breakthroughs in our understanding of type 2 immunity, and highlight the increased complexity existing between the innate and adaptive arms of these responses. These additional steps in the type 2 immune pathway also offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention.	[Oliphant, Chris J.; Barlow, Jillian L.; McKenzie, Andrew N.

IL-9 Governs Allergen-induced Mast Cell Numbers in the Lung and Chronic Remodeling of the Airways	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						IL-9; mast cells; asthma; airway remodeling; AHR	FIBROBLAST-GROWTH-FACTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; PULMONARY INFLAMMATION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; INTERLEUKIN 9; MILD ASTHMA; TGF-BETA; HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; CHALLENGE; EXPRESSION	Rationale: IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has multiple effects on structural as well as numerous hematopoietic cells, which are central to the pathogenesis of asthma. Objectives: The contribution of IL-9 to asthma pathogenesis has thus far been unclear, due to conflicting reports in the literature. These earlier studies focused on the role of IL-9 in acute inflammatory models; here we have investigated the effects of IL-9 blockade during chronic allergic inflammation. Methods: Mice were exposed to either prolonged ovalbumin or house dust mite allergen challenge to induce chronic inflammation and airway remodeling. Measurements and Main Results: We found that IL-9 governs allergen-induced mast cell (MC) numbers in the lung and has pronounced effects on chronic allergic inflammation. Anti-IL-9 antibody-treated mice were protected from airway remodeling with a concomitant reduction in mature MC numbers and activation, in addition to decreased expression of the profibrotic mediators transforming growth factor-beta 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor-2 in the lung. Airway remodeling was associated with impaired lung function in the peripheral airways and this was reversed by IL-9 neutralization. In human asthmatic lung tissue, we identified MCs as the main IL-9 receptor expressing population and found them to be sources of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2. Conclusions: Our data suggest an important role for an IL-9-MC axis in the pathology associated with chronic asthma and demonstrate that an impact on this axis could lead to a reduction in chronic inflammation and improved lung function in patients with asthma.

The purinergic receptor P2Y(2) receptor mediates chemotaxis of dendritic cells and eosinophils in allergic lung inflammation	ALLERGY			English	Article						asthma; ATP; chemotaxis; dendritic cells; eosinophils	OXYGEN RADICAL PRODUCTION; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; CAPACITY; RELEASE; ASTHMA; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION	Background: Extracellular ATP contributes to the pathogenesis of asthma via signalling at purinergic receptors. However, the precise purinergic receptors subtypes mediating the pro-asthmatic effects of ATP have not been identified, yet. Methods: In vivo studies were performed using the OVA-alum model. Functional expression of the P2Y(2) purinergic receptor subtype on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and eosinophils was investigated using real-time PCR, migration assays, and production of reactive oxygen species. Results: Compared to wild-type animals P2Y(2)-/- mice showed reduced allergic airway inflammation which can be explained by defective migration of blood myeloid DCs towards ATP in vitro and in vivo, whereas the influence of ATP on maturation and cytokine production was not changed. Additionally, ATP failed to induce migration of bone marrow-derived eosinophils from P2Y(2)R-deficient animals. The relevance of our findings for humans was confirmed in functional studies with human monocyte-derived DCs and eosinophils. Interestingly, stimulation of human DCs derived from allergic individuals with house dust mite allergen induced functional up-regulation of the P2Y(2)R subtype. Furthermore, eosinophils isolated from asthmatic individuals expressed higher levels of P2Y(2)R compared to healthy controls. This was of functional relevance as these eosinophils were more sensitive to ATP-induced migration and production of reactive oxygen metabolites. Conclusions: In summary, P2Y(2)R appears to be involved in asthmatic airway inflammation by mediating ATP-triggered migration of mDCs and eosinophils, as well as reactive oxygen species production. Together our data suggest that targeting P2Y(2)R might be a therapeutic option for the treatment of asthma.	[Mueller, T.; Vieira, R.

Objective: The primary aim of this study was to further our understanding of the clinical effects associated with home telemonitoring programs in the context of chronic diseases. Methods: We conducted a systematic review which covered studies published between January 1966 and December 2008. MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) database were consulted. Our inclusion criteria consisted of: (I) English language publications in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings and (2) studies involving patients with diabetes, asthma, heart failure, or hypertension, and presenting results on the clinical effects of home telemonitoring. Results: In all, 62 empirical studies were analyzed. The results from studies involving patients with diabetes indicated a trend toward patients with home telemonitoring achieving better glycemic control. In most trials in which patients with asthma were enrolled, results showed significant improvements in patients' peak expiratory flows, significant reductions in the symptoms associated with this illness, and improvements in perceived quality of life. Virtually all studies involving patients with hypertension demonstrated the ability of home telemonitoring to reduce systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. Lastly, due to the equivocal nature of current findings of home telemonitoring involving patients with heart failure, larger trials are still needed to confirm the clinical effects of this technology for these patients. Conclusions: Although home telemonitoring appears to be a promising approach to patient management, designers of future studies should consider ways to make this technology more effective as well as controlling possible mediating variables.

Independent effects of specific pollutants have been difficult to detect because most studies have relied on highly correlated central-site measurements. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the relationship of daily changes in percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 see (FEV1) with personal and ambient air pollutant exposures. METHODS: For 10 days each, we followed 53 subjects with asthma who were 9-18 years of age and living in the Los Angeles, California, air basin. Subjects self-administered home spirometry in the morning, afternoon, and evening. We measured personal hourly PM2.5 mass, 24-hr PM2.5 elemental and organic carbon (EC-OC), and 24-hr NO2, and the same 24-hr average outdoor central-site (ambient) exposures. We analyzed data with transitional mixed models controlling for personal temperature and humidity, and as-needed beta(2)-agonist inhaler use. RESULTS: FEV1 decrements were significantly associated with increasing hourly peak and daily average personal PM2.5, but not ambient PM2.5. Personal NO2 was also inversely associated with FEV1. Ambient NO2 was more weakly associated. We found stronger associations among 37 subjects not taking controller bronchodilators as follows: Personal EC-OC was inversely associated with morning FEV1; for an interquartile increase of 71 mu g/m(3) 1-hr maximum personal PM2.5, overall percent-predicted FEV1 decreased by 1.32% [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.00 to -0.65%]; and for an interquartile increase of 16.8 ppb 2-day average personal NO2, overall percent-predicted FLV1 decreased by 2.45% (95% CI, -3.57 to -1.33%). Associations of both personal PM2.5 and NO2 with FEV1 remained when co-regressed, and both confounded ambient NO2. CONCLUSIONS: Independent pollutant associations with lung function might be missed using ambient data alone. Different sets of causal components are suggested by independence of FEV1 associations with personal PM2.5 mass from associations with personal NO2.

Methods: We determined the range of FENO concentrations and the factors affecting it in a large sample of healthy school children attending grades 4 through 6, in Windsor, ON, Canada. Results: FENO was measured in 657 children between 9.1 and 12.9 years of age. The range of FENO concentrations in healthy school children was 12.7 parts per billion (ppb) [95% confidence interval (0), 11.8 to 13.7 ppb] in whites and 22.8 ppb [95% CI, 17.9 to 27.7 ppb] in Asian-Canadian children (p < 0.001). FENO values also appeared to be higher in African-Canadian children than in whites, although the CI was wide because of the small number of African-Canadian children sampled. FENO rose slightly but significantly with age (p = 0.007) and with height (p = 0.023). Body mass index and gender did not significantly alter the measured FENO. FVC had a nonsignificant effect on FENO. Participation in physical activity during the same day had a borderline-significant effect on measured FENO, but a reported history of a respiratory tract infection in the preceding 2 weeks did not. Conclusions: FENO concentrations in healthy school-aged children appeared to be affected by race, and, to a lesser extent, by age and height. These factors should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical results.

However, few have examined the possible confounding influence of aeroallergens, or reported findings among very young children. Methods: A time stratified case-crossover design was used to examine 57,912 ED asthma visits among individuals two years of age and older in the census metropolitan area of Edmonton, Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air pollution levels for the entire region were estimated from three fixed-site monitoring stations. Similarly, daily levels of aeroallergens were estimated using rotational impaction sampling methods for the period between 1996 and 2002. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity and seasonal epidemics of viral related respiratory disease. Results: Positive associations for asthma visits with outdoor air pollution levels were observed between April and September, but were absent during the remainder of the year. Effects were strongest among young children. Namely, an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for NO(2) and CO levels between April and September was associated with a 50% and 48% increase, respectively, in the number of ED visits among children 2-4 years of age (p < 0.05). Strong associations were also observed with these pollutants among those 75 years of age and older. Ozone and particulate matter were also associated with asthma visits. Air pollution risk estimates were largely unchanged after adjustment for aeroallergen levels. Conclusion: Our findings, taken together, suggest that exposure to ambient levels of air pollution is an important determinant of ED visits for asthma, particularly among young children and the elderly.

Here we characterize the development of allergic airway disease in TRAIL-deficient (Tnfsf10(-/-)) mice and in mice exposed to short interfering RNA targeting TRAIL. We show that TRAIL is abundantly expressed in the airway epithelium of allergic mice and that inhibition of signaling impairs production of the chemokine CCL20 and homing of myeloid dendritic cells and T cells expressing CCR6 and CD4 to the airways. Attenuated homing limits TH2 cytokine release, inflammation, airway hyperreactivity and expression of the transcriptional activator STAT6. Activation of STAT6 by interleukin-13 restores airway hyperreactivity in Tnfsf10(-/-) mice. Recombinant TRAIL induces pathognomic features of asthma and stimulates the production of CCL20 in primary human bronchial epithelium cells. TRAIL is also increased in sputum of asthmatics. The function of TRAIL in the airway epithelium identifies this molecule as a target for the treatment of asthma.

Fragrance ingredient labelling in products on sale in the UK	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						allergic contact dermatitis; consumer products; fragrance; labelling; limonene; linalool	PATCH-TEST POPULATION; ALLERGY; PERFUMES; CHLOROATRANOL; SENSITIZATION; LINALOOL; LYRAL(R); MIX	Background The seventh amendment of the European Union (EU) Cosmetics Directive (March 2005) and the Detergents Regulations of the EU (October 2005) are now legal requirements in Europe. Cosmetic products and detergents must be labelled for 26 individual named fragrances, when present at concentrations of > 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) in leave-on products and > 100 p.p.m. in rinse-off products. Objectives To make an assessment of the exposure pattern to fragrance of the U.K. consumer and to determine the frequency with which the constituent fragrances of fragrance mix I (FM I) and fragrance mix II (FM II) are included in products currently sold in the U.K. Methods A study of perfumed cosmetic and household products available on the shelves of U.K. retailers was carried out in January 2006. Products were included if 'parfum' or 'aroma' was listed among the ingredients. Three hundred products were surveyed and any of the 26 listed fragrances named on the label were recorded. Results The top six most frequently labelled fragrances were linalool (190; 63%), limonene (189; 63%), citronellol (145; 48%), geraniol (126; 42%), butyl phenyl methyl propional (Lilial((TM))) (126; 42%) and hexyl cinnamal (125; (42%). One of these, geraniol, is present in FM I and two others, citronellol and hexyl cinnamal, in FM II, thus tested as part of the British Standard patch test series. The frequencies of other constituents of FM I were as follows: eugenol, 80 (27%); hydroxycitronellal, 52 (17%); isoeugenol, 27 (9%); cinnamic alcohol, 25 (8%); amyl cinnamal, 22 (7%); cinnamal, 17 (6%); Evernia prunastri (oak moss absolute), 13 (4%). The other constituents of FM II occurred as follows: coumarin, 90 (30%); hydroxyisohexyl-3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (Lyral((TM))), 88 (29%); citral, 74 (25%); farnesol, 23 (8%). Linalool (n = 46; 66%) was the most frequently found fragrance in 70 personal care products (soap, shampoo, shower gel). Linalool (n = 47; 80%) and limonene (n = 45; 76%) were the most frequent in 59 products for men (e.g. aftershave). Limonene (n = 29; 51%) predominated in 57 household products (washing-up liquid, detergent). Limonene (n = 43; 98%) and linalool (n = 42; 95%) were the most frequent fragrances in 44 perfumes for women. Alpha-isomethyl ionone (n = 28; 72%) was the most frequent in 39 cosmetics (foundation, lipstick, etc). Citronellol predominated (n = 15; 88%) in 17 deodorants and limonene (n = 9; 64%) was the commonest in 14 dental products (toothpaste and mouthwash). Thirty-four products (11%) contained none of the listed fragrances but were labelled as containing 'parfum' or 'aroma'. Conclusions There is ongoing consumer exposure to the most frequent sensitizers in FM I: E. prunastri, isoeugenol and the cinnamon fragrances cinnamal and cinnamic alcohol. Hydroxyisohexyl-3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (Lyral((TM))) is present at significant concentrations in almost one-third of products. Linalool and limonene, fragrance terpenes which are significant allergens in their oxidized state, are the most frequent fragrances encountered by individuals living in the U.K. The current exposure pattern of the U.K. consumer suggests that we should add oxidized limonene and oxidized linalool to the test series for patients suspected to have fragrance allergy.

COX-2 expression induced by diesel particles involves chromatin modification and degradation of HDAC1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						diesel exhaust particles; COX-2; HDAC; airway epithelial cells	BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 PROMOTER ACTIVATION; ENDOPEROXIDE SYNTHASE-2 GENE; EXHAUST PARTICLES; HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1; REGULATING CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RESPONSE ELEMENT	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in the inflammatory response induced by physiologic and stress stimuli. Exposure to diesel exhaust particulate matter (DEP) has been shown to induce pulmonary inflammation and exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DEP is a potent inducer of inflammatory reponses in human airway epithelial cells. The mechanism through which DEP inhalation induces inflammatory mediator expression is not understood. In this report, we demonstrate that DEP can induce the expression of COX-2 gene in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) at both transcriptional and protein levels. The induction of COX-2 gene expression involves chromatin modification, in particular acetylation and deacetylation of histones. We show that exposure to DEP increases the acetylation of histone H4 associated with the COX-2 promoter and causes degradation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Further, we establish that HDAC1 plays a pivotal role in mediating the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene in BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP, supported by evidence that the down-regulation of HDAC1 using siRNA leads to activation of COX-2 gene expression, whereas overexpression of HDAC1 results in its repression. Finally, DEP exposure induced recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 to the promoter of the COX-2 gene, suggesting that acetylation is also important in regulating its expression in response to DEP exposure. These results show for the first time acetylation via selective degradation of HDAC1, and that recruitment of HAT plays an important role in DEP-induced expression of the COX-2 gene.

Methods: As part of the Housing and Urban Development's American Healthy Homes Survey, dust samples were collected by vacuuming 2 m(2) in the bedrooms plus 2 m(2) in the living rooms from a nationally, representative 1096 homes in the United States using the Mitest sampler. Five milligrams of sieved (300 mu m pore, nylon mesh) dust was analyzed by mold-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the 36 indicator species in 1096 samples. Results: On the basis of this standardized national sampling and analysis, an "Environmental Relative Moldiness Index" was created with values ranging from about -10 to 20 or above (lowest to highest). vi Conclusions: The Environmental Relative Moldiness Index scale may be useful for home mold-burden estimates in epidemiological studies.

Sensitization to Ascaris lumbricoides and severity of childhood asthma in Costa Rica	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Ascaris; helminth; atopy; exacerbation; severity; asthma; Costa Rica	IMMUNOGLOBULIN-E; GEOHELMINTH INFECTIONS; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; ANTHELMINTIC TREATMENT; IGE ANTIBODIES; RURAL AREA; CHILDREN; ATOPY; REACTIVITY; PARASITES	Background: Little is known about sensitization (defined as a positive IgE) to helminths and disease severity in patients with asthma. Objectives: To examine the relationship between sensitization (defined as a positive IgE) to Ascaris lumbricoides and measures of asthma morbidity and severity in a Costa Rican population with low prevalence of parasitic infection but high prevalence of parasitic exposure. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 439 children (ages 6 to 14 years) with asthma. Linear regression and logistic regression were used for the multivariate statistical analysis. Results: After adjustment for parental education and other covariates, sensitization to Ascaris lumbricoides was associated with having at least 1 positive skin test to allergens (odds ratio, 5.15; 95% CI, 2.36-11.21; P < .001), increased total serum IgE and eosinophils in peripheral blood, reductions in FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity, increased airway responsiveness and bronchodilator responsiveness, and hospitalizations for asthma in the previous year (odds ratio, 3.08; 95% Cl, 1.23-7.68; P = .02). Conclusion: Sensitization to Ascaris lumbricoides is associated with increased severity and morbidity of asthma among children in Costa Rica. This association is likely mediated by an increased degree of atopy among children with asthma who are sensitized to Asearis. Clinical implications: In areas with a low prevalence of helminthiasis such as Costa Rica, Ascaris sensitization may be an important marker of severe atopy and disease morbidity in children with asthma.

Dendritic cell recruitment in lesions of human and experimental pulmonary hypertension	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						dendritic cells; immunopathology; inflammation; monocrotaline; pulmonary arterial hypertension	ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; IMATINIB MESYLATE; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; TUMOR; PRECURSORS; ANTIBODIES; DISEASES; ASTHMA	In the present study, the hypothesis that dendritic cells (DCs), key players in immunity and tolerance, might be involved in the immunopathology of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) was tested. The phenotype and localisation of DCs were characterised by immunohistochemistry and double-labelling immunofluorescence in lung samples from controls, human IPAH patients and an experimental pulmonary hypertension model (monocrotaline-exposed rats). As compared with controls, morphometric analysis demonstrated increased numbers of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN)-positive cells in muscular pulmonary arteries in IPAH and OX-62-positive DCs in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. In human samples, the mean +/- SEM number of DC-SIGN-positive cells(.)artery(-1) of 100-300 mu m diameter was 1.4 +/- 0.4 in controls versus 26.4 +/- 2.7 in IPAH. In rats, the number of OX-62-positive cells(.)artery(-1) of 50-150 mu m diameter was 0.5 +/- 0.2 in controls, and 0.7 +/- 0.5, 3.1 +/- 0.5 and 8.4 +/- 0.6 at day 7, 14 and 28 after monocrotaline exposure, respectively. Human complex lesions of muscular pulmonary arteries showed transmural DC infiltration. Phenotyping revealed an immature DC profile in human and experimental pulmonary hypertension. The results support the concept that immature dendritic cells accumulate in remodelled pulmonary vessels and hence could be involved in the immunopathology of pulmonary hypertension.

These environmental pollutants are rapidly being recognized as important and independent risk factors for several diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and stroke. Although the relative effects of particulate matter air pollution (aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu m, or PM10) are greater for respiratory than for cardiovascular deaths, the number of deaths attributable to PM10 is much larger for cardiovascular than for respiratory reasons due to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the general population. This review summarizes current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the associations between PM10 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To determine the activity of a specific Syk inhibitor (11406) on mast cell activation in vitro and on the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in vivo. Methods: AHR and inflammation were induced after 10 d of allergen (ovalbumin [OVA]) exposure exclusively via the airways and in the absence of adjuvant. This approach was previously established to be IgE, Fc epsilon RI, and mast cell dependent. Alternatively, mice were passively sensitized with OVA-specific IgE, followed by limited airway challenge. In vitro, the inhibitor was added to cultures of IgE-sensitized bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) before crosslinking with allergen. Results: The inhibitor prevented OVA-induced degranulation of passively IgE-sensitized murine IBMMCs and inhibited the production of interieukin (IL)-13, tumor necrosis factor a, IL-2, and IL-6 in these sensitized BMMCs. When administered in vivo, R406 inhibited AHR, which developed in BALB/c mice exposed to aerosolized 1% OVA for 10 consecutive d (20 min/d), as well as pulmonary eosinophilia and goblet cell metaplasia. A similar inhibition of AHR was demonstrated in mice passively sensitized with OVA-specific IgE and exposed to limited airway challenge. Conclusion: This study delineates a functional role for Syk in the development of mast cell- and IgE-mediated AHR and airway inflammation, and these results indicate that inhibition of Syk may be a target in the treatment of allergic asthma.

The Inner-City Asthma Study, a randomized trial involving home environmental allergen and irritant remediation among children aged 6 through 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma, successfully reduced asthma symptoms. A cost-effectiveness analysis can help stakeholders to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of adopting such a program. Objective: We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of the environmental intervention of the Inner-City Asthma Study. Methods: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for a 2-year study period were calculated. Health outcome was measured as symptom-free days. Resource use measures included ambulatory visits, hospitalizations, and pharmaceutical use. CIs were obtained by using bootstrapping. Results: The intervention, which cost $1469 per family, led to statistically significant reductions in symptom days, unscheduled clinic visits, and use of beta-agonist inhalers. Over the year of the intervention and a year of follow-up, the intervention cost was $27.57 per additional symptom-free day (95% CI, $7.46-$67.42). Subgroup analysis showed that targeting the intervention to selected high-risk subgroups did not reduce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Conclusions: A targeted home-based environmental intervention improved health and reduced service use in inner-city children with moderate-to-severe asthma. The intervention is cost-effective when the aim is to reduce asthma symptom days and the associated costs.

The molecular mechanisms of this PAH-mediated inflammation remain to be clarified. Previous studies implied the involvement of PAHs as irritants and allergens, with the reactive oxygen species generated from the oxygenated PAHs believed to be an exacerbating factor. It is also possible that PAHs contribute to the pathogenesis through activation of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated transcription, since PAHs are potent inducers of the AhR. To address this point, we generated transgenic mouse lines expressing the constitutive active form of the AhR in keratinocytes. In these lines of mice, the AhR activity was constitutively enhanced in the absence of ligands, so that any other direct effects of PAHs and their metabolites could be ignored. At birth, these transgenic mice were normal, but severe skin lesions with itching developed postnatally. The skin lesions were accompanied by inflammation and immunological imbalance and resembled typical atopic dermatitis. We demonstrate that constitutive activation of the AhR pathway causes inflammatory skin lesions and suggests a new mechanism for the exacerbation of inflammatory diseases after exposure to occupational and environmental xenobiotics.

This could reflect either a decrease in sensitization with aging or a higher prevalence of sensitization in more recent birth cohorts. Objective: To assess change in IgE sensitization and mean total IgE in young adults as they age. Methods: Serum specific IgE to common allergens and total IgE were measured on 2 occasions about 9 years apart in 6371 young adults living in 28 centers, mainly in Western Europe, who took part in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II. Outcomes were analyzed by using generalized estimating equations, and adjustments were made for differences between laboratory measures on the 2 occasions. Results: Overall, there was no net change in the prevalence of sensitization to at least 1 of house dust mite, grass, or cat (net change per 10 years of follow-up, -0.1%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 1.5%), although there was a fall in mean total IgE (ratio of geometric mean total IgE, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.93). There was evidence that sensitization to at least 1 allergen was higher in more recent cohorts, and this was largely explained by a higher prevalence of sensitization to grass. Conclusion: The disease burden associated with IgE sensitization in adults, and particularly with IgE sensitization to grass, is likely to continue to increase for some time despite current evidence that the increase in allergy seen in children may have ceased.

Antibiotics disturb the flora of the gastrointestinal tract, possibly perturbing the developing immune system. Objective: We evaluated whether antibiotic use during early infancy increased the risk for atopy. Methods: Antibiotic prescriptions documented in medical records were collected from a birth cohort born from 1987 through 1989 (n=725). At 6 to 7 years of age, 448 were followed by means of examination, including skin prick tests and serum IgE measurements to common allergens. Results: Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were calculated comparing children with any versus those with no antibiotic use in the first 6 months and the outcomes of atopy (any positive skin test response), seroatopy (any positive specific IgE test result), either atopy or seroatopy, and both atopy and seroatopy. Atopy increased with antibiotic use approaching statistical significance (aOR, 1.48, 95% Cl, 0.94-2.34; P =.09)., however, the risk was concentrated among children with less than 2 pets in the home (aOR, 1.73; 95% Cl, 1.07-2.80; P=.024) and children breast-fed for 4 or more months (aOR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.27-7.17; P=.013). The aORs were generally in the same direction for seroatopy and the combined categories. Conclusion: Antibiotic use in early life appears to contribute to increased risk for atopy in certain subgroups of children.

Our aim was to determine the prevalence and the clinical characteristics of hypersensitivity to platinum salts and to other elements of the platinum group. Methods: A total of 153 subjects working in a catalyst manufacturing and recycling factory were examined. The examination consisted of a work exposure and medical questionnaire, physical examination, skin prick test for PGEs and other common aeroallergens, and patch tests for PGEs. Skin prick tests and patch tests were performed with H-2[PtCl6], K-2[PtCl4], Na-2[PtCl6], IrCl3, RhCl3, PdCl2, aqueous solutions at different concentrations. Results: Positive prick test reactions to Pt-salts at various concentrations were found in 22 (14.4%) of 153 workers; eight had simultaneous reactions to all Pt-salts tested; seven had positive responses to H-2[PtCl6] only; four had simultaneous positive reactions to both H-2[PtCl6] and K-2[PtCl4]; three had positive reactions to H-2[PtCl6] and Na-2[PtCl6]. Three of 22 had positive reactions to H-2[PtCl6] and IrCl3 solutions, two of these had positive reactions to H-2[PtCl6], IrCl3 and RhCl3 solutions. Positive patch test reactions to platinum salts at day 2 were seen in two of 153 subjects. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that Pt-salts are important allergens in the catalyst industry and that the clinical manifestations involve both the respiratory system and the skin. Hexachloroplatinic acid should be considered the most important salt to use for skin prick tests.

The mass concentration is strongly influenced by the large particles. Therefore, particle mass is a poor measure for characterizing the amount of the small, possibly more biologically potent particles. We used polystyrene particles (PSP) ranging in diameter from 0.0588 to 11.14 mum, carbon black (CB), and diesel exhaust particles (DEP), to study the adjuvant effect of particles on the immune response to the allergen ovalbumin (OVA) after sc injection into the footpad of BALB/cA mice. At a given mass dose, the small particles (0.0588 and 0.202 mum PSP, CB, and DEP) increased the allergen-specific IgE serum levels to a substantially higher degree than the larger particles (1.053, 4.64, and 11.14 mum PSP). Further, in the draining lymph node during the primary response, the fine particles (0.202 mum) with OVA increased cell numbers, expression of surface markers (CD19, MHC class II, CD86, and CD23) and ex vivo production of IL-4 and IL-10, whereas the largest (11.14 mum) particles did not. Linear regression analyses indicated that the IgE response was not predicted by particle mass (R-2 = 0.06), but was predicted by the total particle surface area (R-2 = 0.64), number of particles (R-2 = 0.62), and particle diameter (R-2 = 0.58). In conclusion, we found that fine particles exerted stronger adjuvant effects on allergic responses than larger particles at equal mass doses. Consequently, the dose described as total particle surface area or particle number predicts the adjuvant effect of particles better than the currently used particle mass.

Objective This study investigated whether GSTP1 genotypes and outdoor air pollution were interactive risk factors on childhood asthma. Methods Four hundred and thirty-six subjects were recruited for oral mucosa samplings from 2853 fourth- to ninth-grade schoolchildren from three districts with different air pollution levels in southern Taiwan. PCR-based assays were performed by oral mucosa DNA to determine GSTP1 genotypes. We also conducted a nested case-control study comprising 61 asthmatic children and 95 controls confirmed by International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire results and methacholine challenge test. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. Results All participants were homozygous at the Ala-114 locus. Although only a marginally significant association existed between the frequency of homozygosity at the Ile-105 locus and asthma when air pollution was not considered, we found a significant gene-environmental interaction between GSTP1-105 alleles and air pollution after adjusting for confounders (P=0.035). Specifically, we found that compared with participants carrying any Val-105 allele in low air pollution, those who are Ile-105 homozygotes in high air pollution district had a significantly increased risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=5.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.64-21.25). Compared with participants carrying any Val-105 allele, in high air pollution district, children with Ile-105 homozygotes had a significantly increased risk of asthma (AOR=3.79, 95% CI=1.01-17.08), but those who carried two Ile-105 alleles in low or moderate air pollution districts did not show similar tendencies. The risk of asthma also revealed a clear dose-response relationship with outdoor air pollution in children with Ile-105 homozygotes. Conclusion Our result suggests a gene-environmental interaction between GSTP1-105 genotypes and outdoor air pollution on childhood asthma.

Peanut allergy affects around 1% of the population and is a common food allergy associated with severe clinical manifestations. The exact route of primary sensitization is unknown although the gastrointestinal immune system is likely to play an important role. Exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to soluble antigens normally leads to a state of antigen-specific systemic hyporesponsiveness (oral tolerance). A deviation from this process is thought to be responsible for food-allergic diseases. In this study, we have developed a murine model to investigate immunoregulatory processes after ingestion of peanut protein and compared this to a model of oral tolerance to chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA). We demonstrate that oral tolerance induction is highly dose dependent and differs for the allergenic proteins peanut and OVA. Tolerance to peanut requires a significantly higher oral dose than tolerance to OVA. Low doses of peanut are more likely to induce oral sensitization and increased production of interleukin-4 and specific immunoglobulin E upon challenge. When tolerance is induced both T helper 1 and 2 responses are suppressed. These results show that oral tolerance to peanut can be induced experimentally but that peanut proteins have a potent sensitizing effect. This model can now be used to define regulatory mechanisms following oral exposure to allergenic proteins on local, mucosal and systemic immunity and to investigate the immunomodulating effects of non-oral routes of allergen exposure on the development of allergic sensitization to peanut and other food allergens.

In mice, RSV infection enhances allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Dendritic cells are critical in inducing T-cell responses to both viruses and allergens and could be pivotal in regulating interactions between these. Objective: This study addresses the effects of RSV infection on phenotype and function of pulmonary dendritic cells. Methods: BALB/c mice were infected with RSV, and expression of CD11c, MHC II, and CD86 on lung and spleen cells was monitored by flow cytometry for 21 days after infection. CD11c(+) cells were isolated to assess their phagocytic capacity and their ability to induce proliferation in allogenic T cells. Results: Numbers of pulmonary CD11c(+) MHC IIhi cells increased 13-fold starting from day 6 after RSV infection. This was associated with increased CD86 expression, reduced phagocytosis, and increased allogenic T-cell stimulatory capacity in CD11c(+) cells. These changes in the lung outlasted acute infection and were not observed in spleens. Conclusion: RSV infection results in sustained increases in numbers of mature dendritic cells in the lung. These might well contribute to the development of intense airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness after RSV infection and to enhancement of subsequent responses to allergen exposure.

Objective: We sought to determine the clinical relevance of exposure to peanut butter by means of inhalation and skin contact in children with peanut allergy. Methods: Children with significant peanut allergy (recent peanut-specific IgE antibody concentration >50 kIU/L or evidence of peanut-specific IgE antibody and one of the following: clinical anaphylaxis, a reported inhalation-contact reaction, or positive double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge result to peanut) underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized exposures to peanut butter by means of contact with intact skin (0.2 mL pressed flat for 1 minute) and inhalation (surface area of 6.3 square inches 12 inches from the face for 10 minutes). Placebo challenges were performed by using soy butter mixed with histamine (contact), and scent was masked with soy butter, tuna, and mint (inhalation). Results: Thirty children underwent the challenges (median age, 7.7 years; median peanut IgE level, >100 kIU/L; 13 with prior history of contact and 11 with inhalation reactions). None experienced a systemic or respiratory reaction. Erythema (3 subjects), pruritus without erythema (5 subjects), and wheat-and-flare reactions (2 subjects) developed only at the site of skin contact with peanut butter. From this number of participants, it can be stated with 96% confidence that at least 90% of highly sensitive children with peanut allergy would not experience a systemic-respiratory reaction from casual exposure to peanut butter. Conclusions: Casual exposure to peanut butter is unlikely to elicit significant allergic reactions. The results cannot be generalized to larger exposures or to contact with peanut in other forms (flour and roasted peanuts).

Data base searches indicate that this gene encodes a novel prototype galectin that contains one putative carbohydrate recognition domain and exhibits most identity to galectin-9/ecalectin, a potent eosinophil chemoattractant. The sugar binding properties of the recombinant molecule were confirmed by a hemagglutination assay and lactose inhibition. The mRNA and protein of galectin-14 are expressed at high levels in eosinophil-rich cell populations. Flow cytometry and cytospot staining demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasmic, but not the granular, compartment of eosinophils. In contrast, galectin-14 mRNA and protein were not detected in neutrophils, macrophages, or lymphocytes. Western blot analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicates that galectin-14 is released from eosinophils into the lumen of the lungs after challenge with house dust mite allergen. The restricted expression of this novel galectin to eosinophils and its release into the lumen of the lung in a sheep asthma model indicates that it may play an important role in eosinophil function and allergic inflammation.

CAAA is a community-based participatory research collaboration among academia, health agencies, and community-based organizations. CAAA investigates the effects of environmental exposures on the residents of Detroit through a participatory process that engages participants from the affected communities in all aspects of the design and conduct of the research; disseminates the results to all parties involved; and uses the research results to design, in collaboration with all partners, interventions to reduce the identified environmental exposures. The CAAA PM exposure assessment includes four seasonal measurement campaigns each year that are conducted for a 2-week duration each season. In each seasonal measurement period, daily ambient measurements of PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mum and 10 mum, respectively) are collected at two elementary schools in the eastside and southwest communities of Detroit. Concurrently, indoor measurements Of PM2.5 and PM10 are made at the schools as well as inside the homes of a subset of 20 children with asthma. Daily personal exposure measurements of PM10 are also collected for these 20 children with asthma. Results from the first Five seasonal assessment periods reveal that mean personal PM10 (68.4 +/- 39.2 mug/m(3)) and indoor home PM10 (52.2 +/- 30.6 mug/m(3)) exposures are significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the outdoor PM10 concentrations (25.8 +/- 11.8 mug/m(3)). The same was also found for PM2.5 (indoor PM2.5 = 34.4 21.7 mug/m(3); outdoor PM2.5 = 15.6 +/- 8.2 mug/m(3)). In addition, significant differences (p < 0.05) in community-level exposure to both PM10 and PM2.5 are observed between the two Detroit communities (southwest PM10 = 28.9 +/- 14.4 mug/m(3), PM2.5 = 17.0 +/- 9.3 mug/m(3), eastside PM10 = 23.8 +/- 12.1 mug/m(3), PM2.5 = 15.5 +/- 9.0 mug/m(3)). The increased levels in the southwest Detroit community are likely due to the proximity to heavy industrial pollutant point sources and interstate motorways. Trace element characterization of filter samples collected over the 2-year period will allow a more complete assessment of the PM components. When combined with other project measures, including concurrent seasonal twice-daily peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume at 1 sec and daily asthma symptom and medication dairies for 300 children with asthma living in the two Detroit communities, these data will allow not only investigations into the sources of PM in the Detroit airshed with regard to PM exposure assessment but also the role of air pollutants in exacerbation of childhood asthma.

We and others have shown that severe and sudden asthma is associated with airway neutrophilia, and that 03 oxidative stress is likely to augment neutrophilic airway inflammation in severe asthma. However, very little is known about chemokines that orchestrate oxidative stress-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation in vivo. To identify these chemokines, three groups of BALB/c mice were exposed to sham air, 0.2 ppm O-3, or 0.8 ppm O-3 for 6 h. Compared with sham air, 0.8 ppm O-3, but not 0.2 ppm O-3, induced pronounced neutrophilic airway inflammation that peaked at 18 h postexposure. The 0.8 ppm 03 up-regulated lung mRNA of CXCL1,2,3 (mouse growth-related oncogene-a and macrophage-inflammatory protein-2), CXCL10 (IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10), CCL3 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha), CCL7 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-3), and CCL11 (eotaxin) at 0 h postexposure, and expression of CXCL10, CCL3, and CCL7 mRNA was sustained 18 h postexposure. 03 increased lung protein levels of CXCL10, CCL7, and CCR3 (CCL7R). The airway epithelium was identified as a source of CCL7. The role of up-regulated chemokines was determined by administering control IgG or IgG Abs against six murine chemokines before 03 exposure. As expected, anti-mouse growth-related oncogene-a inhibited neutrophil recruitment. Surprisingly, Abs to CCL7 and CXCL10 also decreased neutrophil recruitment by 63 and 72%, respectively. These findings indicate that CCL7 and CXCL10, two chemokines not previously reported to orchestrate neutrophilic inflammation, play a critical role in mediating oxidative stress-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation. These observations may have relevance in induction of neutrophilia in severe asthma.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the health and socioeconomic outcomes of subjects with latex-induced asthma before and after reduction or cessation of exposure to latex. Methods: Thirty-six subjects with latex-induced asthma as ascertained by specific inhalation challenges were investigated after a median follow-up of 56 months (range, 12 to 92 months). Initial and follow-up visits included use of a detailed questionnaire and measurement of the concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). At follow-up, information on employment, financial status, and quality of life was collected. Results: At follow-up, 16 subjects were no longer exposed to latex, whereas 20 subjects had reduced exposure. In the subjects who avoided exposure, asthma severity decreased from a median score of 8.5 to 3.5 (P = .001) and the median histamine PC20 value increased from 0.4 mg/mL to 2.3 mg/mL (P = .002). In the subjects who reduced their exposure, asthma-severity score improved from 6.5 to 2.5 (P < .001) and PC20 values rose from 0.5 mg/mL to 2.4 mg/mL (P < .001). Cessation of exposure to latex was associated with asthma-related work disability (69%) and loss of income (62%) more frequently than was reduction of exposure (35% and 30%, respectively). Conclusion: Reduction of exposure to latex should be considered a reasonably safe alternative that is associated with fewer socioeconomic consequences than removal from exposure.

The objectives of this investigation were a) to determine if racial minorities are more adversely affected by ambient air pollution than their white counterparts and b) to assess the contribution of socioeconomic status to any observed racial differences in pollution effect. Time-series regression methods were conducted to investigate these hypotheses for daily respiratory hospital admissions in New York City, New York. Pollutants considered included mean daily levels of particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mum (PM10), ozone (O-3), strong aerosol acidity (H+), and sulfates (SO42). The relative risk for respiratory hospital admission was calculated for each pollutant for a maximum minus mean increment in mean daily pollutant concentration. The greatest difference between the white and nonwhite subgroups was observed for O-3, where the white relative risk (RR) was 1.032 [95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.977-1.089] and the nonwhite RR was 1.122 (95% Cl: 1.074-1.172). Although not statistically different from each other, the various pollutants' RR estimates for the Hispanic nonwhite category in New York City were generally larger in magnitude than those for the non-Hispanic white group. When these analyses incorporated differences in the underlying respiratory hospitalization rates across races (that for nonwhites, was roughly twice that for whites), the disparities in attributable risks from pollution (in terms of excess admissions per day per million persons) were even larger for nonwhites versus whites. However, when insurance status was used as an indicator of socioeconomic/health coverage status, higher RRs were indicated for the poor/working poor (i.e., those on Medicaid and the uninsured) than for those who were economically better off (i.e., the privately insured), even among non-Hispanic whites. Thus, although potential racial differences in pollution exposures could not be explored as a factor, within-race analyses suggested that most of the apparent differences in air pollutant effects found across races were explained by socioeconomic and/or health care disparities.

Apparently, the ability of a food protein to induce an allergic response requires its presence in substantial amounts in the food supply, its durability during food processing, and its resistance to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to the mode and degree of exposure, structural characteristics appear to play an important, role for the capacity of a protein to modulate the immune response towards allergic reactions. Until now, however, there has been no indication for common structural characteristics of linear T cell or linear IgE (B cell) epitopes and the knowledge of structural characteristics of conformational IgE binding sites is very limited. Experimental data point only to certain surface areas of allergenic proteins which are important for IgE binding. Therefore, it is not possible to suggest any structural motif or conformational sequence pattern common to all allergenic proteins. Furthermore, glycosylation appears not to be a common critical determinant of allergenicity since food allergens comprise both glycoproteins and nonglycosylated proteins. Based on the few published three-dimensional structures of allergenic proteins including food proteins, one unifying feature of allergens appears to be their spherical shape. The three-dimensional structures of many more allergens have to be determined, however, to allow for a better understanding of the molecular basis of allergenicity. Most recently, new ideas have been introduced as to why certain biochemical or biologic functions such as enzymatic activities may predispose a protein to become an allergen. Proteolytically active allergens have been demonstrated to irritate the human mucosal surface, to enhance their own transmucosal uptake, and to augment IgE production. Therefore, the functional activity of some allergens may play a role among other factors in the process of sensitization and allergic responses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Design: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-period, crossover clinical trial. Setting: Twenty-four clinics and university medical centers in nine countries. Patients: One hundred seventy-two patients with baseline FEV1, less than or equal to 65% predicted, with FEV, reversibility to salbutamol not exceeding the normal variability of the measurement, and symptomatic despite regular treatment with ipratropium bromide. Interventions: Each patient received two treatments in random order: either inhaled formoterol dry powder, 12 mug bid, in addition to ipratropium bromide, 40 mug qid for 3 weeks, followed by salbutamol, 200 mug qid, in addition to ipratropium, 40 mug qid for 3 weeks, or vice versa. Measurements and results: Efficacy end points included morning premedication peak expiratory now (PEF) during the last week of treatment (primary end point), the area under the curve (AUC) for FEV, measured for 6 h after morning dose on the last day of treatment, and symptom scores (from daily diary recordings). Morning PEF and the AUC for FEV,were significantly better for formoterol/ipratropium than for salbutamol/ipratropium (p = 0.0003 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The formoterol/ipratropium combination also induced a greater improvement in mean total symptom scores (p = 0.0042), The safety profile of the two treatments was comparable. Conclusions: In COPD patients requiring combination bronchodilator treatment, the addition of formoterol to regular ipratropium treatment is more effective than the addition of salbutamol.

Methods: We randomly assigned 24 children allergic to grass pollen to receive local allergoid immunotherapy for 3 months before the pollen season and 24 such patients to receive identically appearing placebo. The immunotherapy consisted of tablets of monomeric allergoid grass pollen allergens held in the mouth until they dissolved and then swallowed. The study was double-blind. Symptoms and medications were scored on diary cards during the pollen season. Nasal eosinophil cationic protein levels were measured by the monoclonal antibodies EG1 and EG2 outside the pollen season and at low and at high pollen concentration during the pollen season. Results: The active-treatment group had a statistically significant reduction of total symptoms (P < 0.05), especially bronchial symptoms (P < 0.05), in comparison with the placebo group. Immunotherapy was well tolerated and compliance was good. Nasal levels of EG2 and EG1 increased significantly during the pollen season, but there was no difference between groups. EG2/EGI increased significantly only in the placebo group during natural allergen exposure (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that this immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of asthma due to grass pollen in children.

Exposure to the antigen mainly occurs through the respiratory mucosa and the percutaneous route. Clinical manifestations range from urticaria to angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, bronchial asthma, or anaphylactic shock. Preventive measures have been proposed to reduce the risk of sensitization by using only powder-free or synthetic gloves and latex-free material in operating units, but this is not always possible. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of specific immunotherapy in sensitized workers. Methods: Seventeen patients with latex skin allergy and rhinitis (9 of whom also had asthma) were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (9 in the active group and 8 in the placebo group) for 1 year. Treatment started with a 2-day course of rush immunotherapy in hospital. Treatment efficacy was assessed after 6 and 12 months by means of symptom and medication scores recorded on diary cards. Conjunctival provocation tests were also performed. Results: Patients in the active treatment group had a significantly tower total rhinitis score after 6 (P < .04) and 12 months (P < .05), conjunctivitis score after 6 months (P < .02), and cutaneous score after 12 months (P < .03) than in the placebo group, Asthma symptoms after 6 or 12 months of treatment were not significantly different between the two groups after adjustment for baseline values. The global medication score was markedly decreased in the latex-treated group. A significant difference in conjunctival reactivity was observed in favor of the active group: the number of patients for whom the threshold dose was increased after 12 months of treatment was significantly greater in the active group than in the placebo group (P < .02). Most injections were well tolerated, but several adverse effects, including hypotension, urticaria, wheezing, and pharyngeal edema, were observed. Conclusion: The clinical benefits observed during the present study included a significant improvement of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous symptoms. Immunotherapy also decreased allergen-specific conjunctival reactivity. Latex-specific immunotherapy may allow sensitized personnel to remain at work, but further trials need to be conducted in a larger number of patients.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of the specific LTRA montelukast at 5 mg/d for 2 d on the bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation of cold, dry air in 13 asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoconstriction was measured as the specific airway resistance (sRaw) in a whole-body plethysmograph before and 4 min after challenge with cold, dry air. The repeatability of the bronchoprotection was examined by repeating the placebo-controlled study in six of the 13 children. sRaw increased by an average of 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30 to 63%) after placebo treatment and 17% (95% CI: 3 to 31%) after montelukast (p < 0.01). Eight of the children were receiving regular treatment with budesonide delivered by an inhaler with a spacer in a mean daily dose of 350 mu g, but the bronchoprotection provided by montelukast was independent of concurrent steroid treatment. There was no convincing evidence of failure to respond, and the protective effect of montelukast was consistent upon repeated testing (p = 0.02). We conclude that the LTRA montelukast provided clinically significant bronchoprotection against the effect of hyperventilation of cold dry air in asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoprotection appeared to be homogeneous among the children, and seemed independent of steroid treatment. This suggests that LTRAs may be of therapeutic use in limiting clinical symptoms of asthma in young children.

Preliminary evidence from small human studies suggest a similar age-dependent response pattern to vaccines, but detailed investigations on vaccine immunity during infancy have not yet been undertaken. We report below the results of a comprehensive prospective study on responses to the tetanus component of the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in a cohort of 55 healthy children, employing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month vaccinations and at 12 months. Antigen-specific production of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was determined at each sample point, in parallel with polyclonal (phytohemagglutinin PHA-induced) cytokine responses. Our results indicate early and persistent Th2 responses to the vaccine, in contrast to a more delayed and transient pattern of IFN-gamma production, This initial disparity between the Th1 and Th2 components of the vaccine response was mirrored by patterns of polyclonally induced cytokine production, suggesting that the delayed maturation of the Th1 component of the vaccine response during infancy is secondary to developmental processes occurring within the overall Th cell system.

This review examines the immune processes that are candidate targets for modulation by environmental agents; environmental and lifestyle factors that have been suggested as modulators of the development of atopy; and the impact of known environmental agents on atopic processes in the airway. The most important periods of immune development with regard to expression of atopy are likely during gestation and early childhood. A better understanding of which environmental agents are important, as well as the period of life during which these agents may exert an important effect, is essential to devising rational environmental avoidance strategies for at-risk populations.

Objective: The present study examines the effect of nasal allergen provocation on subsequent endotoxin challenge in subjects with atopic asthma. Methods: By using a split-nose randomized crossover design, individual nares of 12 asthmatic subjects underwent challenge and lavage as follows, Immediately after a baseline nasal lavage, one nares received normal saline, and the other received dust mite antigen, Four hours later both nares were exposed to either saline or endotoxin. Dust mite antigen (Dermatophagoides farinae) and endotoxin (Escherichia roll 026:B6) doses were 100 AU and 1000 ng, respectively. Postchallenge lavages were done at 8 and 24 hours after the initial challenge. The subjects then returned a minimum of 3 weeks later for crossover to the study arm. Nasal lavage fluid was analyzed for total and differential cell counts, IL-8, IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, GM-CSF, eosinophil cationic protein, myeloperoxidase, and soluble CD14. Results: A significant increase in the total inflammatory cell count was seen at 8 hours for the dust mite/endotoxin exposure compared with the saline/saline and saline/endotoxin exposures. Differential cell counts revealed a similar neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation for the dust mite/endotoxin exposure at 8 hours. Conclusions: These data demonstrate an interaction between allergen and endotoxin exposure in asthmatic subjects, suggesting that a prior allergen challenge significantly augments the endotoxin-induced inflammation. Moreover, these data provide further evidence that concomitant exposure to allergen and endotoxin may he an important factor in asthma pathogenesis.

We reviewed the epidemiological literature examining the relationship between early life phthalate exposure and pediatric health outcomes. Recent findings Five studies from Asia, Europe, and the United States suggest that childhood exposure to di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) may increase the risk of allergic diseases including asthma and eczema. Six studies from four different prospective cohorts report that gestational BBzP, DEHP, di-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) exposures are associated with alterations in infant/toddler physical development as well as parent-reported externalizing, internalizing, and autistic-like child behavior. However, there are inconsistencies related to the specific phthalates and behavioral domains. Two small studies report shorter anogenital distance among male infants with higher gestational phthalate exposure. Summary Several epidemiological studies suggest fetal and childhood exposure to some phthalates may perturb normal development, with several studies consistently reporting increased risk of allergic diseases with DEHP and BBzP exposure. Although anticipatory guidance is not evidence-based at this time, providers can counsel concerned patients to reduce phthalate exposures in order to protect the developing fetus and child from potential adverse health outcomes.

The Relationship Between Trees and Human Health Evidence from the Spread of the Emerald Ash Borer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; STREET TREES; GREEN SPACE; ASTHMA; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; FOREST; AREAS	Background: Several recent studies have identified a relationship between the natural environment and improved health outcomes. However, for practical reasons, most have been observational, cross-sectional studies. Purpose: A natural experiment, which provides stronger evidence of causality, was used to test whether a major change to the natural environment-the loss of 100 million trees to the emerald ash borer, an invasive forest pest-has influenced mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory diseases. Methods: Two fixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the relationship between emerald ash borer presence and county-level mortality from 1990 to 2007 in 15 U. S. states, while controlling for a wide range of demographic covariates. Data were collected from 1990 to 2007, and the analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Results: There was an increase in mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory-tract illness in counties infested with the emerald ash borer. The magnitude of this effect was greater as infestation progressed and in counties with above-average median household income. Across the 15 states in the study area, the borer was associated with an additional 6113 deaths related to illness of the lower respiratory system, and 15,080 cardiovascular-related deaths. Conclusions: Results suggest that loss of trees to the emerald ash borer increased mortality related to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory-tract illness. This finding adds to the growing evidence that the natural environment provides major public health benefits.

High concentrations of biological aerosol particles and ice nuclei during and after rain	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							NUCLEATION-ACTIVE BACTERIA; MINERAL DUST PARTICLES; FUNGAL SPORES; PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; THUNDERSTORM ASTHMA; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; AIRBORNE BACTERIA; SPLASH DISPERSAL; UV-APS	Bioaerosols are relevant for public health and may play an important role in the climate system, but their atmospheric abundance, properties, and sources are not well understood. Here we show that the concentration of airborne biological particles in a North American forest ecosystem increases significantly during rain and that bioparticles are closely correlated with atmospheric ice nuclei (IN). The greatest increase of bioparticles and IN occurred in the size range of 2-6 mu m, which is characteristic for bacterial aggregates and fungal spores. By DNA analysis we found high diversities of airborne bacteria and fungi, including groups containing human and plant pathogens (mildew, smut and rust fungi, molds, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae). In addition to detecting known bacterial and fungal IN (Pseudomonas sp., Fusarium sporotrichioides), we discovered two species of IN-active fungi that were not previously known as biological ice nucleators (Isaria farinosa and Acremonium implicatum). Our findings suggest that atmospheric bioaerosols, IN, and rainfall are more tightly coupled than previously assumed.	[Huffman, J.

Objectives: We sought to evaluate the potential determinants of physician-diagnosed asthma after severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy. Methods: We enrolled 206 children during an initial episode of severe RSV bronchiolitis at 12 months of age or less in a prospective cohort study and followed these children for up to 6 years. In a subset of 81 children, we analyzed CCL5 (RANTES) mRNA expression in upper airway epithelial cells. Results: Forty-eight percent of children had physician-diagnosed asthma before the seventh birthday. Independent determinants significantly associated with increased risk for physician-diagnosed asthma by the seventh birthday included maternal asthma (odds ratio [OR], 5.2; 95% CI, 1.7-15.9; P = .004), exposure to high levels of dog allergen (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.7; P = .012), aeroallergen sensitivity at age 3 years (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.1-55.0; P = .005), recurrent wheezing during the first 3 years of life (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.2-43.3; P = .028), and CCL5 expression in nasal epithelia during acute RSV infection (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P < .001). White children (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.93; P = .041) and children attending day care (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.84; P = .029) had a decreased risk of physician-diagnosed asthma. Conclusions: Approximately 50% of children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis have a subsequent asthma diagnosis. The presence of increased CCL5 levels in nasal epithelia at the time of bronchiolitis or the development of allergic sensitization by age 3 years are associated with increased likelihood of subsequent asthma.

Ventilation in European dwellings: A review	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Ventilation; Rates; Regulations; Health	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; INDOOR AIR-QUALITY; HOUSE-DUST; BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; CATALAN DWELLINGS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MITE ALLERGEN; LONG-TERM	Adequate ventilation is essential for the health and comfort of building occupants. This review examines, first of all, why residential ventilation is an issue of concern in Europe and how is related to the human health. A review of the current status of residential ventilation standards and regulations in Europe is also provided, as a reference. Finally, a review of measurements of ventilation rates in European dwellings is provided, where the compatibility with the European standards/regulations is examined. The review shows that ventilation is increasingly becoming recognised as an important component of a healthy dwelling. Ventilation requirements receive major attention in building regulations, across Europe. However, ventilation measurements across Europe show that ventilation is in practice often poor, resulting in reduced ventilation rates (lower than 0.5 h(-1), which is currently a standard in many European countries), increased concentrations of indoor pollutants and hence exposure to health risk. Surveys showed that although occupants generally think that ventilation is important, their understanding of the ventilation systems in their own houses is low, resulting to under-ventilated homes.

Evidence for Family-Centered Care for Children With Special Health Care Needs: A Systematic Review	ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS			English	Review						children with special health care needs; family-centered care	MEDICAL HOME; NATIONAL-SURVEY; MENTAL-HEALTH; ASTHMA; SERVICES; OUTCOMES; SATISFACTION; PHYSICIANS; INSURANCE; EDUCATION	OBJECTIVE: Family-centered care (FCC) has received widespread endorsement for use in care in the United States. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of evidence for FCC focusing specifically on family-provider partnership as the activity that constitutes FCC. METHODS: We found and reviewed articles from the medical, nursing, psychology, and sociology literature spanning 1986 to 2010. We also reviewed articles obtained through related references and through recommendations from key informants. Four sets of terms were used to search, including FCC, child/adolescent, children with special health care needs (CSHCN, defined broadly or by condition), and a relevant outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the review criteria. Eight were cross-sectional studies from the National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs, and 7 were reports of randomized, controlled trials. Of the 24 articles reviewed, 13 examined populations of CSHCN or similar populations, 6 examined children with asthma, and the remaining studied children with other specific conditions. We found positive associations of FCC with improvements in efficient use of services, health status, satisfaction, access to care, communication, systems of care, family functioning, and family impact/cost. There was little available evidence, however, for some outcomes, including cost and transition. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that FCC is associated with improved outcomes for CSHCN.

Tobacco-Smoke Exposure in Children Who Live in Multiunit Housing	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						secondhand smoke; passive smoking; environmental tobacco smoke; multiunit housing; apartment	SECONDHAND SMOKE; THIRDHAND-SMOKE; UNITED-STATES; US CHILDREN; NICOTINE; ASSOCIATION; ASTHMA; HOME; ADOLESCENTS; DUST	OBJECTIVE: There is no safe level of secondhand tobacco-smoke exposure, and no previous studies have explored multiunit housing as a potential contributor to secondhand tobacco-smoke exposure in children. We hypothesized that children who live in apartments have higher cotinine levels than those who live in detached homes, when controlling for demographics. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2001-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The housing types we included in our study were detached houses (including mobile homes), attached houses, and apartments. Our study subjects were children between the ages of 6 and 18 years. Cotinine levels were used to assess secondhand tobacco-smoke exposure, and those living with someone who smoked inside the home were excluded. chi(2) tests, t tests, and Tobit regression models were used in Stata. Sample weights accounted for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Of 5002 children in our study, 73% were exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. Children living in apartments had an increase in cotinine of 45% over those living in detached houses. This increase was 212% (P < .01) for white residents and 46% (P < .03) for black residents, but there was no significant increase for those of other races/ethnicities. At every cutoff level of cotinine, children in apartments had higher rates of exposure. The exposure effect of housing type was most pronounced at lower levels of cotinine. CONCLUSIONS: Most children without known secondhand tobacco-smoke exposure inside the home still showed evidence of tobacco-smoke exposure. Children in apartments had higher mean cotinine levels than children in detached houses. Potential causes for this result could be seepage through walls or shared ventilation systems. Smoking bans in multiunit housing may reduce children's exposure to tobacco smoke.

Double-stranded RNA induces disproportionate expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin versus interferon-beta in bronchial epithelial cells from donors with asthma	THORAX			English	Article							MEDIATED ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-3; RHINOVIRUS INFECTION; VIRAL-INFECTIONS; PROTEIN-KINASE; IN-VITRO; EXACERBATIONS; CHEMOKINES; DISEASE; PHENOTYPE	Background Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that strongly activates dendritic cells and can initiate allergic inflammation. Since exposure to rhinovirus or double-stranded (ds) RNA (a surrogate of viral infection) induces TSLP expression in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), this cytokine may link innate antiviral responses and the type 2 adaptive immune response. Objective As BECs from donors with asthma have a deficient interferon (IFN) response to rhinovirus infection, a study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that their antiviral response shows a bias towards TSLP production. Methods Primary BECs were grown from subjects with asthma and healthy volunteers. After exposure to dsRNA, interleukin (IL)-8, IFN beta and TSLP mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Results dsRNA dose-dependently increased IL-8 expression in BECs with no significant difference between the groups. However, BECs from subjects with asthma expressed less IFN beta and more TSLP mRNA and protein in response to dsRNA than BECs from those without asthma (median (IQR) 57 (38-82) pg/ml vs 106 (57-214) pg/ml for IFN beta (p<0.05) and 114 (86-143) pg/ml vs 65 (32-119) pg/ml for TSLP (p<0.05) in response to 10 mu g/ml dsRNA for 24 h). Induction of TSLP mRNA by dsRNA was blocked by Toll-like receptor 3 or protein kinase inhibitors or by preventing de novo protein synthesis, but not by neutralisation of type I IFN receptors. Conclusion BECs from subjects with asthma are biased towards higher TSLP and lower IFN beta production in response to dsRNA, suggesting that viral infection in asthma may lead to an altered mediator profile that biases towards a Th2 immune response.

Maternal Bisphenol A Exposure Promotes the Development of Experimental Asthma in Mouse Pups	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						airway hyperresponsiveness; asthma; bisphenol A; environmental estrogen; eosinophilia; experimental asthma; IgE; maternal exposure; perinatal sensitization	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; T-CELL RESPONSES; BREAST-MILK; EARLY-LIFE; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; CORD-BLOOD; ER-ALPHA; MICE	BACKGROUND: We recently reported that various environmental estrogens induce mast cell degranulation and enhance IgE-mediated release of allergic mediators in vitro. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that environmental estrogens Would enhance allergic sensitization as well as bronchial inflammation and responsiveness. To test this hypothesis, we exposed fetal and neonatal mice to the common environmental estrogen bisphenol A (BPA) via maternal loading and assessed the pups' response to allergic sensitization and bronchial challenge. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice received 10 mu g/mL BPA in their drinking water from I week before impregnation to the end of the study. Neonatal mice were given a single 5 mu g intraperitoneal dose of ovalbumin (OVA) with aluminum hydroxide on postnatal day 4 and 3% OVA by nebulization for 10 ruin on days 13, 14, and 15. Forty-eight hours after the last nebulization, we assessed serum IgE antibodies to OVA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by enumerating eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole-body barometric plethysmography, and a forced oscillation technique. RESULTS: Neonates from BPA-exposed mothers responded to this "suboptimal" sensitization with higher serum IgE anti-OVA concentrations compared with those from unexposed mothers (p < 0.05), and eosinophilic inflammation in their airways was significantly greater. Airway responsiveness of the OVA-sensitized neonates from BPA-treated mothers was enhanced compared with those from unexposed mothers (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal exposure to BPA enhances allergic sensitization and bronchial inflammation and responsiveness in a Susceptible animal model of asthma.

Influence of comorbid conditions on asthma	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Review						Asthma comorbidities; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; glottic dysfunction; obesity; obstructive sleep apnoea; rhinitis/sinusitis	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; ALLERGIC RHINITIS; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; SLEEP-APNEA; FOLLOW-UP; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; INCIDENT ASTHMA; LUNG-FUNCTION; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX	Various conditions such as rhinosinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, psychological disturbances, chronic Infections and obstructive sleep apnoea are often observed In asthmatic patients and may affect asthma control and outcomes. These comorbidities may change the asthma phenotype, be part of the same pathophysiological process, act as confounding factors In the diagnosis or assessment of control of asthma, and/or result from specific environmental exposures. The Influences of these conditions on asthma are variable and for many of them still uncertain; nevertheless, they may alter asthma responses to current therapy. A systematic evaluation and an appropriate treatment of asthma-associated comorbid conditions should be part of asthma management, particularly for severe disease. With regard to clinical research, associated conditions may Influence the results of trials and should be taken Into account in the subjects' Inclusion criteria and analysis of data.

Asthma in Latin America: a public health challenge and research opportunity	ALLERGY			English	Review						asthma; allergy; Latin America; urbanization	SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI INFECTION; BODY-MASS INDEX; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; RISK-FACTORS; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION; ASCARIS-LUMBRICOIDES; COSTA-RICA; RURAL AREA; BRONCHIAL RESPONSIVENESS	Asthma has emerged as an important public health problem in many Latin American countries over the past decade. In Brazil and Costa Rica, the prevalence of asthma and associated morbidity is as great or greater as reported in traditional high prevalence countries such as the US, but remains neglected as a public health priority. Asthma in Latin America is associated particularly with underprivileged populations living in cities but remains relatively rare in many rural populations. The causes of asthma in Latin America are likely to be associated with urbanization, migration, and the adoption of a modern 'Westernized' lifestyle and environmental changes that follow these processes that include changes in diet, physical activity, hygiene, and exposures to allergens, irritants, and outdoor and indoor pollutants. Because of the enormous social, genetic, and environmental contrasts within and between Latin American countries, and the large differences in prevalence associated with these differences, the investigation of asthma in Latin America provides important research opportunities to identify the social and biological mechanisms that underlie asthma development. Asthma in Latin America poses enormous challenges for health policy makers, health services, and researchers to respond to and alleviate the growing burden of asthma disability, particularly among marginalized urban populations.

Diet-induced obesity causes innate airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and enhances ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; chemokine; leptin; lung elastance; resistance	HIGH-FAT DIET; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; INDUCED LUNG INFLAMMATION; BODY-MASS INDEX; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; TISSUE MECHANICS; DEFICIENT MICE; C57BL/6J MICE; ASTHMA; RESPONSES	We previously reported that genetically obese mice exhibit innate airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and enhanced ozone (O-3)-induced pulmonary inflammation. Such genetic deficiencies in mice are rare in humans, and they may not be representative of human obesity. Thus the purpose of this study was to determine the pulmonary phenotype of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), which more closely mimics the cause of human obesity. Therefore, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were reared from the time of weaning until at least 30 wk of age on diets in which either 10 or 60% of the calories are derived from fat in the form of lard. Body mass was similar to 40% greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. Baseline airway responsiveness to intravenous methacholine, measured by forced oscillation, was greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. We also examined lung permeability and inflammation after exposure to room air or O-3 (2 parts/million for 3 h), an asthma trigger. Four hours after the exposure ended, O-3-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, interleukin-6, KC, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10, and eotaxin were greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. Innate AHR and augmented responses to O-3 were not observed in mice raised from weaning until 20-22 wk of age on a 60% fat diet. These results indicate that mice with DIO exhibit innate AHR and enhanced O3-induced pulmonary inflammation, similar to genetically obese mice. However, mice with DIO must remain obese for an extended period of time before this pulmonary phenotype is observed.

The prevalence of atopic triad in children with physician-confirmed atopic dermatitis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							FOLLOW-UP; ASTHMA; CHILDHOOD; PREDISPOSE; MUTATIONS; ALLERGIES; EXPOSURE; CRITERIA; ECZEMA; ISAAC	Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is often associated with comorbidities such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Objective: We sought to describe the frequency of these comorbidities in children with AD Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the first 2270 children with physician-confirmed AD enrolled in a large postmarketing cohort. All were queried for information on comorbidities using a questionnaire from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Results: In all, 71.3% reported at least one additional form of atopy (symptoms of asthma or allergic rhinitis). A total of 33.3% reported only symptoms of asthma or allergic rhinitis whereas 38.0% reported I symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis. By age 3 years, nearly 66% reported at least one additional form of atopy. A statistically significant trend toward poorer disease control was observed for those with additional atopic illnesses (P <.001). Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study Conclusion: Individuals with AD exhibit a predisposition to additional atopic illnesses by age 3 years and in turn the presence of these illnesses correlates with poor disease control.

Occupational health problems in modern dentistry: A review	INDUSTRIAL HEALTH			English	Review						dentistry; infectious diseases; dermatitis; musculoskeletal pain	GENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONERS; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; SOUTHERN THAILAND; BACTERIAL AEROSOLS; HAND DERMATITIS; LATEX; PERSONNEL; PREVALENCE; ALLERGY; INFECTION	Despite numerous technical advances in recent years, many occupational health problems still persist in modern dentistry. These include percutaneous exposure incidents (PEI); exposure to infectious diseases (including bioaerosols), radiation, dental materials, and noise; musculoskeletal disorders; dermatitis and respiratory disorders; eye injuries; and psychological problems. PEI remain a particular concern, as there is an almost constant risk of exposure to serious infectious agents. Strategies to minimise PEI and their consequences should continue to be employed, including sound infection control practices, continuing education and hepatitis B immunisation. As part of any infection control protocols, dentists should continue to utilise personal protective measures and appropriate sterilisation or other high-level disinfection techniques. Aside from biological hazards, dentists continue to suffer a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially of the back, neck and shoulders. To fully understand the nature of these problems, further studies are needed to identify causative factors and other correlates of MSD. Continuing education and investigation of appropriate interventions to help reduce the prevalence of MSD and contact dermatitis are also needed. For these reasons, it is therefore important that dentists remain constantly informed regarding up-to-date measures on how to deal with newer technologies and dental materials.

Identification and quantification of oxidation products and effect on skin sensitization	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							OXIDIZED D-LIMONENE; LYMPH-NODE ASSAY; DERMATITIS; HYDROPEROXIDES; ALDEHYDES; CAPACITY; LINALOOL; POTENCY; COMMON	Fragrances are common causes of contact allergy. Geraniol (trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadiene-1-ol) is an important fragrance terpene. It is considered a weak contact allergen and is used for fragrance allergy screening among consecutive dermatitis patients. Analogous to other monoterpenes studied, such as limonene and linalool, geraniol has the potential to autoxidize on air exposure and form highly allergenic compounds. The aim of the present study was to investigate and propose a mechanism for the autoxidation of geraniol at room temperature. To investigate whether allergenic compounds are formed, the sensitizing potency of geraniol itself, air-exposed geraniol, and its oxidation products was determined using the local lymph node assay in mice. The results obtained show that the allylic alcohol geraniol follows an oxidation pattern different from those of linalool and limonene, which autoxidize forming hydroperoxides as the only primary oxidation products. The autoxidation of geraniol follows two paths, originating from allylic hydrogen abstraction near the two double bonds. From geraniol, hydrogen peroxide is primarily formed together with aldehydes geranial and neral from a hydroxyhydroperoxide. In addition, small amounts of a hydroperoxide are formed, analogous to the formation of the major linalool hydroperoxide. The autoxidation of geraniol greatly influenced the sensitizing effect of geraniol. The oxidized samples had moderate sensitizing capacity, quite different from that of pure geraniol. The hydroperoxide formed is believed to be the major contributor to allergenic activity, together with the aldehydes geranial and neral. On the basis of the present study and previous experience, we recommend that the possibility of autoxidation and the subsequent formation of contact allergenic oxidation products are considered in risk assessments performed on fragrance terpenes.

Thunderstorm-asthma and pollen allergy	ALLERGY			English	Review						allergic asthma; bronchial asthma; bronchial hyperreactivity; climate changes; environment and allergy; pollen allergy; pollinosis; respiratory allergy; thunderstorm-asthma	GRASS-POLLEN; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; AIR-POLLUTION; HAY-FEVER; EPIDEMICS; RISK; SENSITIZATION; COMMUNITY; ORBICULES; OUTBREAK	Thunderstorms have been linked to asthma epidemics, especially during the pollen seasons, and there are descriptions of asthma outbreaks associated with thunderstorms, which occurred in several cities, prevalently in Europe (Birmingham and London in the UK and Napoli in Italy) and Australia (Melbourne and Wagga Wagga). Pollen grains can be carried by thunderstorm at ground level, where pollen rupture would be increased with release of allergenic biological aerosols of paucimicronic size, derived from the cytoplasm and which can penetrate deep into lower airways. In other words, there is evidence that under wet conditions or during thunderstorms, pollen grains may, after rupture by osmotic shock, release into the atmosphere part of their content, including respirable, allergen-carrying cytoplasmic starch granules (0.5-2.5 mu m) or other paucimicronic components that can reach lower airways inducing asthma reactions in pollinosis patients. The thunderstorm-asthma outbreaks are characterized, at the beginning of thunderstorms by a rapid increase of visits for asthma in general practitioner or hospital emergency departments. Subjects without asthma symptoms, but affected by seasonal rhinitis can experience an asthma attack. No unusual levels of air pollution were noted at the time of the epidemics, but there was a strong association with high atmospheric concentrations of pollen grains such as grasses or other allergenic plant species.

In the present study, we evaluate the contribution of the proteolytic activity and structure of a highly purified rDer p 1 to immune responses. Mice were i.p. immunized with three forms of rDer p I adsorbed to Alum: one enzymatically active, one treated with an irreversible cysteine protease-specific inhibitor, E-64, and one heat denatured. Immunization with E-64-treated or heat-denatured rDer p I elicited much less production of serum total IgE and not only rDer p 1-specific IgE but also IgGs compared with immunization with active rDer p 1. Assays for Ab-binding and its inhibition and structural analyses indicated that E-64-treated rDer p I retained its global structure and conformational B cell epitopes. A proliferative response and production of IL-5 by spleen cells restimulated with rDer p I were observed on immunization with the active rDer p 1 but not E-64-treated rDer p 1. The cells from mice immunized with heat-denatured rDer p I exhibited the highest levels of proliferation and production of IL-5 and IFN-gamma. The results indicate that the proteolytic activity of the highly purified rDer p I crucially commits to the sensitization process, including both IgE and IgG responses. Additionally, we demonstrated immunogenic differences by functional or structural manipulations of the rDer p 1. The findings have implications for sensitization to this relevant allergen in humans and for the design of modified allergen-vaccines for future allergen-specific immunotherapy.

Methods: A prospective, randomized, comparative trial was planned involving 57 Italian pulmonology centers and 570 GPs who had to enroll consecutive subjects aged IS to 65 years with symptoms of asthma or COPD without a previous diagnosis. Patients were randomized 1:1 into two groups with an interactive voice responding system: conventional evaluation alone vs conventional evaluation and spirometry. Office spirometry was performed by GPs who were trained by reference specialists using a portable electronic spirometer (Spirobank Office; MIR; Home, Italy). Diagnosis was confirmed by the reference specialist center in blind fashion. Results: Seventy-four GPs complied to the trial. Of :333 patients enrolled, 136 nonrandom violators completed the protocol. Per-protocol analysis showed a concordant diagnosis between GPs and specialists in 78.6% of cases in the conventional evaluation-plus-spirometry group vs 69.2% in the conventional evaluation group (p = 0.35). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the respective percentages of concordant diagnosis were 57.9 and 56.7 (p = 0.87). Conclusions: Office spirometry by GPs is feasible, but frequent protocol violation and inadequate sample size did not allow us to prove a significant advantage of office spirometry in improving the diagnosis of asthma and COPD in standard general practice as organized at present in Italy, thus reinforcing the need for close cooperation between GPs and specialists in respiratory medicine.

In the present study, we investigate the effects of maternal smoking in pregnancy on asthma, hayfever, atopic eczema, and wheezing in the offspring up to the age of 14-18. The study was based on a cohort of mothers enrolled during midwife visits around the 36th week of gestation in Odense and Aalborg, Denmark, 1984-1987. Singleton, live born children (n=11 144) were followed-up in 2002 to obtain a childhood history of atopic diseases, by means of questionnaires to the parents. Multivariate logistic regression analyses for medical diagnoses of asthma, hayfever, atopic eczema, and symptoms of wheezing before the age of 3, were carried out on 7844 children. After adjustment for confounders, late prenatal smoke exposure was associated with wheezing, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.2, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.1-1.5. Furthermore, slightly reduced estimates for hayfever (OR 0.8, CI 0.7-1.0) and atopic eczema (OR 0.8, CI 0.7-0.9) were obtained for children exposed in late pregnancy compared with non-exposed. Late gestational smoke exposure was associated with wheezing but not with asthma, while null or even protective estimates were indicated for hayfever and atopic eczema. However, lack of control options for hereditary factors may have affected the results.

The production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by activated T cells is involved in the augmentation of Th2-type immune responses to particles, and IL-25 induces the synthesis of 11-4 and IL-13. However, whether IL-13 and IL-25 are directly regulated by particle instillation in the lung has not been studied. The aim of this study was to reveal particle induction of IL-13 and IL-25 in the lung. TiO2 instillation potently induced the mRNA expression for IL-25 and IL-13 in lung tissue extracts 24 h after treatment, as compared with the sham group. Immunostaining for IL-25 and IL-13 showed strong positivity for macrophages in the inflammatory lung lesions of TiO2-treated rats. The alveolar macrophages expressed IL-25 and IL-13 24h after in vitro stimulation with TiO2 particles in dose- and time-dependent manners, with maximal induction at 24 and 48 h after stimulation, respectively. The sequence of the rat IL-25 gene is 95% homologous with the mouse IL-25 gene. These findings indicate that alveolar macrophages play an important role in particle-induced lung inflammation via direct induction of IL-13 and IL-25 production.

This has been related to environmental factors, like changes of microbial pressure. Our previous studies have demonstrated differences in the intestinal microbiota between allergic and non-allergic children. Aim To test the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and IgE response are related, both in allergic and non-allergic 5-year-old Estonian children. Methods The study group comprised 19 allergic and 19 non-allergic 5-year-old children, selected from a larger group who had been followed from birth. The diagnosis of allergy was based on clinical examination of the children and on data obtained from the questionnaires. The faecal microbiota were quantified by seeding serial dilutions on nine different media for incubation in different environment. The composition of the gut microbiota was expressed both as absolute counts of the various species and their relative share among the total counts of identified microbiota. Results Bifidobacteria were less commonly detected in children with allergic diseases than in healthy children and clostridia comprised a higher proportion among their gut microbes. Children with specific IgE antibodies to defined allergens had higher counts of clostridia and the counts of clostridia correlated with the level of serum IgE, but only so in allergic children. In non-allergic children, the serum IgE levels showed a positive correlation with the counts of bacteroides. Conclusion The development of allergic diseases seems to be associated with the composition of the gut microbial ecosystem. High counts of potential pathogens, such as clostridia, are associated with clinical manifestations of allergy and IgE antibody formation.

Among the candidate genes in this region is CD14. Methods: To determine whether polymorphisms in the CD14 gene are related to this gene-by-environment interaction in Latinos, we used both family-based and cross-sectional cohort analysis to test for interactions between CD14 genotypes/haplotypes, exposure to ETS, and asthma-related phenotypes in 659 Mexican and Puerto Rican families. Results: We identified 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD14 gene by sequencing 72 Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and African Americans with asthma. Three SNPs, -810, -159, and +1437, were further genotyped in families with asthma. Among all subjects with asthma exposed to ETS, without regard to ethnicity, CD14 +1437 genotypes were associated with asthma severity. SNP +1437 GG or GC genotypes were significantly associated with lower baseline FEV1, using both family-based (p = 0.0009) and cross-sectional cohort (p 0.03) analyses. Subjects with asthma with the GG or GC genotypes who were exposed to ETS had mean baseline FEV1 (% predicted) values 8.6% lower than subjects not exposed to ETS (p = 0.03). As previously observed in whites, we found an interaction between plasma IgE levels, SNP -159 genotypes, and ETS exposure (p = 0.0002). The lowest IgE levels were in those subjects with the TT genotype and who were exposed to ETS regardless of ethnicity. Conclusions: Our data suggest a gene-by-environment interaction between CD14 genotypes and ETS, which affects pulmonary function and IgE levels among Latinos with asthma.

Objective: We investigated the degree of food allergen sensitization in inner-city patients with asthma. Methods: Five hundred four random serum samples from the National Cooperative Inner City Asthma Study were evaluated for specific IgE (UniCap) to 6 common food allergens (egg, milk, soy, peanut, wheat, and fish). Statistical analyses were performed to determine food sensitization prevalence and its association with asthma morbidity. Results: Forty-five percent of patients had evidence of sensitization (food-specific IgE &GE; 0.35 kU/L) to at least 1 food. Nineteen percent had IgE levels at &GE; 50% positive predictive value for clinical reactivity to at least 1 food, with 4% of patients having levels &GT; 95% positive predictive value for food allergy. Children sensitized to foods had higher rates of asthma hospitalization (P &LT; .01) and required more steroid medications (P = .025). Sensitization to foods also correlated with sensitization to more indoor and outdoor aeroallergens (P &LT; .001). Conclusion: Food allergen sensitization is highly prevalent in the inner-city population with asthma, and it is associated with increased asthma healthcare and medication use. Therefore, food allergen sensitivity may be a marker for increased asthma severity.

Objective: To quantify airborne and settled dust Mus m 1 levels in homes of inner-city patients with asthma and to identify risk factors for mouse allergen exposure. Methods: One hundred inner-city school-age children with asthma in Baltimore underwent skin testing to a panel of aeroallergens, and their homes were inspected by a trained technician. Air and settled dust were sampled in the child's bedroom. Mus m 1, particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM10), and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns were quantified in air samples, and Mus m 1 was quantified in settled dust samples. Results: Mus m 1 was detected in settled dust samples from 100% of bedrooms. Airborne mouse allergen was detected in 48 of 57 (84%) bedrooms, and the median airborne mouse allergen concentration was 0.03 ng/m(3). The median PM10 concentration was 48 mug/m(3). Airborne and settled dust mouse allergen levels were moderately correlated (r = .52; P < .0001), and airborne Mus m 1 and PM10 levels were weakly correlated (r =.29; P = .03). Having cracks or holes in doors or walls, evidence of food remains in the kitchen, and mouse infestation were all independently associated with having detectable airborne mouse allergen. Conclusion: Airborne mouse allergen concentrations in many inner-city homes may be similar to those found in animal facilities, where levels are sufficiently high to elicit symptoms in sensitized individuals. Exposed food remains, cracks and holes in doors or walls, and evidence of mouse infestation appear to be risk factors for having detectable airborne Mus m 1.

Global transcript expression profiling was used to define the spectrum and kinetics of chemokine involvement in an experimental murine model of asthma. Seventeen chemokines were induced in the lungs of allergen-inoculated mice, as compared with saline-treated mice. Two (CXCL13 and CCL9) of the 17 identified chemokines have not previously been associated with allergic airway disease. Seven (7 of 17; CCL2, CCL7, CCL9, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL10) of the allergen-induced chemokines were induced early after allergen challenge and remained induced throughout the experimental period. Three chemokines (CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL17) were induced only during the early phase of the inflammatory response after the initial allergen challenge, while seven chemokines (CCL6, CCL8, CCL12, CCL22, CXCL9, CXCL12, and CXCL13) were increased only after a second allergen exposure. Unexpectedly, expression of only three chemokines, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22, was STAT6 dependent, and many of the identified chemokines were overexpressed in STAT6-deficient mice, providing an explanation for the enhanced neutrophilic inflammation seen in these mice. Notably, IFN-gamma and STAT1 were shown to contribute to the induction of two STAT6-independent chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10. Taken together, these results show that only a select panel of chemokines (those targeting Th2 cells and eosinophils) is positively regulated by STAT6; instead, many of the allergen-induced chemokines are negatively regulated by STAT6. Collectively, we demonstrate that allergen-induced inflammation involves coordinate regulation by STAT1, STAT6, and IFN-gamma.

Transferring exercise programmes to the community and sustaining them long term is a challenge for the patient. The effectiveness of an individualised unsupervised home based exercise programme was examined in adults with cystic fibrosis over a 1 year period. Methods: Subjects were randomised to undertake three sessions per week of upper and lower body exercise based on individualised preferences (n = 30) or to a control group ( n = 18). They were evaluated at baseline and at 12 months. The primary outcome measure was improved fitness as assessed by change in blood lactate concentration at the end of an identical constant work rate for both arm and leg ergometric testing. Secondary outcome measurements were heart rate and pulmonary function. Results: For leg exercise, significant differences were seen at 12 months between the active and control groups in the mean (SE) change in blood lactate levels (-0.38 (0.23) mmol/l v 0.45 (0.25) mmol/l, p<0.05) and heart rate (-4.8 (2.5) bpm v 3.4 (2.5) bpm, p<0.05), confirming a training effect. For arm ergometry there was no change in lactate levels at 12 months but there was a significant difference in forced vital capacity (46 (72) ml v -167 (68) ml, p<0.05). Conclusions: A training effect, as measured by a reduction in lactate levels and heart rate, can be achieved with unsupervised individualised home exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis. A benefit to pulmonary function was observed and together these findings suggest that exercise programmes should be encouraged as an important component of care in cystic fibrosis.

Objective: To assess prenatal fatty acid exposures as predictors of early childhood wheezing and eczema. Methods: In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, late pregnancy maternal blood samples and umbilical cord blood samples were assayed for n-6 and n-3 fatty acids (percentage of total red cell phospholipid), and mothers were asked about wheezing and eczema in their children. We measured associations of 11 n-6 and n-3 fatty acid exposures with wheezing at 30 to 42 months, with wheezing patterns defined by presence (+) or absence (-) of wheezing during 2 periods, 0 to 6 months and 30 to 42 months (transient infant, +/-; later-onset, -/+; persistent, +/+; n = 1191 and n = 2764 for cord and maternal analyses, respectively), and with eczema at 18 to 30 months (n = 1238 and n = 2945 for cord and maternal analyses, respectively). Results: In cord blood red cells, the ratio of arachidonic:eicosapentaenoic acid was positively associated with eczema (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per doubling, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P = .044), the ratio of linoleic acid: a-linolenic acid was positively associated with later-onset wheeze (OR, 1.30; CI, 1.04-1.61; P = .019), and the ratio of a-linolenic acid:n-3 products was negatively associated with later-onset wheeze (OR, 0.86; CI, 0.75-0.99; P = .040). However, these associations were no longer significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: It seems unlikely that fetal exposure to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids is an important determinant of early childhood wheezing and atopic disease.

Design Multicentre epidemiological survey. Setting Three cities in china. Participants 10 902 schoolchildren aged 10 years. Main outcome measures Asthma and atopic symptoms, atopic sensitisation, and early and current exposure to environmental factors. Results Children from Hong Kong had a significantly higher prevalence of wheeze in the past year than those from Guangzhou and Beijing (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 1.99). Factors during the first year of life and currently that were significantly associated with wheeze were cooking with gas (odds ratio 2.04, 1.34 to 3.13), foam pillows (2.58, 1.66 to 3.99), and damp housing (1.89,1.26 to 2.83). Factors protecting against wheeze were cotton quilts and the consumption of fruit and raw vegetables. Conclusion Environmental factors and diet may explain the differences in prevalence of asthma between children living in different regions of China.

Exposures were gathered via dust sample collection at children's home in their first year of life. Families provided complete outcome data (wheezing status in all 4 years) for 1,289 children. Domestic allergen levels varied substantially between centers. Six hundred three (47%) children never wheezed during their first 4 years of life. Der p1 did not correlate with any type of wheezing outcome. Fel d1 significantly increased the risk of wheezing in 3- and 4-year-olds in comparison to 1-year-olds. Distinct risk profiles were found for wheezing at different ages. Multivariate analysis revealed an interaction between Fel d1 and maternal asthma among children who wheeze in Year 4 (relative risk = 2.77; 95% confidence interval = 1.19-6.46). Our data support the idea that several patterns of wheezing with different risk profiles exist among young children. The effect of Fel d1 exposure varied according to age and maternal asthma.

Objective: The cow's milk-specific T-cell response of donors with various allergic backgrounds was investigated. Methods: Cow's milk-specific T-cell clones (TCCs) were generated from the blood of children with persistent cow's milk allergy (CMA) and the blood of cow's milk-tolerant allergic and nonallergic control subjects. The TCCs were characterized by their antigen-specific proliferation, cytokine production, and activation status. Results: Cow's milk-specific TCCs of children with persistent CMA were T(H)2 skewed, and the production of IL-4 and IL-13 was significantly correlated with the expression of the activation marker CD25. TCCs of the allergic control subjects were characterized by a high production of IL-10, which was positively correlated with the production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma and with the expression of CD25. TCCs derived from nonallergic control subjects had an attenuated response toward cow's milk in that they did not produce high levels of cytokines nor did they express high levels of surface markers. As in the allergic control subjects, in the nonallergic control subjects IL-10 production was positively correlated with the expression of CD25. Conclusion: The activation status of T cells derived from persistent donors with CMA was associated with the production of IL-4 and IL-13, whereas activated TCCs of cow's milk-tolerant control subjects were characterized by the production of IL-10 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-gamma. These findings suggest that activated CD4(+) T cells (characterized by a high CD25 expression) might contribute to the tolerogenic immune response toward an antigen, such as cow's milk, through the production of IL-10.

This work has found that the female fetus alters maternal asthma during pregnancy by upregulating maternal inflammatory pathways. When asthma-associated inflammatory pathways are not treated with inhaled steroids during pregnancy, the female fetus has reduced growth and adrenal function due to alterations in placental glucocorticold metabolism. When the mother uses inhaled steroid for the treatment of her asthma during pregnancy, female fetal growth and placental function are comparable to the control population. The growth of the male fetus appears to be unaffected by asthma or inhaled steroid use. These findings indicate there may be different mechanisms regulating placental glucocorticoid and immune mechanisms depending on fetal sex in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic pregnancies.

Th2 cells; vitamin D; asthma; cytoskeleton rearrangement; migration	HIGH ENDOTHELIAL VENULES; DENDRITIC CELLS; IFN-GAMMA; RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; B-CELLS; D-3; ACTIVATION; MICE; INHIBITION	The fat soluble vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)(2)D-3], and its nuclear receptor play an important role in regulating immune responses. While 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 is known to inhibit transcription of cytokine genes that are required for Th1 differentiation or are products of differentiated Th1 cells, its role in regulating differentiation of Th2 cells is less clear. In this study, we show that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 has anti-inflammatory effects in an in vivo Th2-dependent asthma model. In addition, we demonstrate that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 down-regulates the cytoskeleton rearrangement required for promoting integrin-mediated adhesion of naive and effector CD4(+) T cells. Finally, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 inhibits chemokine-induced migration of naive cells and their homing to the lymph nodes. Thus, in addition to its regulation of cytokine transcription, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 regulates migration of cells and thus controls the skewing of various Th subsets in the secondary lymphoid organs and inhibits Th function at sites of inflammation.

Risk in relation to occupation was increased only for men-for bakers and food processors (OR = 8.62, 95% CI: 0.86, 86.5), textile workers (OR = 4.70, 95% CI: 0.29, 77.1), electrical and electronic production workers (OR 2.83, 95% CI: 0.82, 6.93), laboratory technicians (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 0.17, 16.6), and storage workers (OR 1.57, 95% CI: 0.40, 6.19). Of the predominantly men's occupations, metal (OR = 4.52, 95% CI: 2.35, 8.70) and forestry (OR = 6.00, 95% CI: 0.96, 37.5) work were the strongest determinants of asthma. For women, asthma risk increased for waiters (OR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.10, 8.31), cleaners (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.81, 2.48), and dental workers (OR = 4.74, 95% CI: 0.48, 46.5). Results suggest an increased asthma risk both in traditional industries and forestry and in several nonindustrial occupations.

The aim of this study was to assess the risk of asthma in women employed in domestic cleaning. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in 4521 women aged 30 to 65 years. Information on respiratory symptoms and cleaning work history was obtained using a postal questionnaire with telephone follow up. Asthma was defined as reported symptoms in the last year or current use of drugs to treat asthma. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for asthma in different cleaning groups were estimated using adjusted unconditional logistic regression models. Results: 593 women (13%) were currently employed in domestic cleaning work. Asthma was more prevalent in this group than in women who had never worked in cleaning (OR 1.46 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.92)). Former domestic cleaning work was reported by 1170 women (26%), and was strongly associated with asthma (OR 2.09 (1.70 to 2.57)). Current and former non-domestic cleaning work was not significantly associated with asthma. Consistent results were obtained for other respiratory symptoms. Twenty five per cent of the asthma cases in the study population were attributable to domestic cleaning work. Conclusions: Employment in domestic cleaning may induce or aggravate asthma. This study suggests that domestic cleaning work has an important public health impact, probably involving not only professional cleaners but also people undertaking cleaning tasks at home.

A number of genes and chromosomal regions have been identified that consistently show linkage to asthma and its related phenotypes. Known loci modify the strength of the atopic response, nonspecific inflammation, the ability to respond to particular allergens and nonspecific airway reactivity. Eczema has been shown to be due to a different set of genetic loci that are shared with other skin diseases such as psoriasis and leprosy. Genetic and genomic studies both provide evidence that epithelial surfaces are active in the induction of allergic disease.

Aim To evaluate to what extent climate and outdoor NO2 pollution can explain the geographical variation in the prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis, and to estimate the relative risk for exposure to different levels of these two factors. Methods The impact of climate and long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution on asthma and allergic rhinitis was assessed in a cross-sectional study, carried out during 1998 to 2000 on young adults aged 20 to 44 years (n = 18 873), living in 13 areas from two different Italian climatic regions (subcontinental and Mediterranean). Results Mediterranean areas had a significantly higher prevalence of asthma-like symptoms (P < 0.001), higher annual mean temperature (16.2 degreesC vs. 12.9 degreesC), lower temperature range (16.0 Cdegrees vs. 22.1 Cdegrees) and lower NO2 levels (31.46 mug/m(3) vs. 57.99 mug/m(3)) than subcontinental ones. Mediterranean climate was associated with an increased risk of wheeze (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35), tightness in the chest (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.33), shortness of breath (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36) and asthma attacks (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31). After adjusting for climate, an increase of 18.3 mug/m(3) in NO2 levels moderately increased the risk of asthma attacks (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.32), tightness in the chest (OR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.26) and wheeze (OR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.28). When the levels of outdoor NO2 exposure rose, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased significantly in the Mediterranean region (OR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69), but not in the subcontinental one (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.28). Conclusion Our results show that the prevalence of asthma increases when annual mean temperature increases and temperature range decreases. Furthermore, climate interacts with NO2 outdoor exposure, increasing the risk for allergic rhinitis in people exposed to high stable temperatures. A long-term role for the effect of traffic pollution on asthma is also suggested.

We evaluated the association of allergen sensitization and home exposure to short and long-term morbidity in 140 women with asthma and to asthma prevalence in 458 women from metropolitan Boston. Cockroach (Blattella germanica), dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae), and cat (Felis domesticus) allergens in home dust samples, and specific immunoglobulln E antibodies were measured at outset, and doctor-diagnosed asthma and markers of asthma morbidity were ascertained by questionnaire during a 4-year follow-up. Cat- and cockroach-sensitive (immunoglobulin E immunocap [Cap] class greater than or equal to 1) women with asthma reported greater morbidity in the past year at the start, and during follow-up, if high levels of the relevant allergen were found. Women with asthma sensitized to cat allergen and with concentrations at 8 mug/g or greater were more likely to have used steroid (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.7 [1.2-6.2]) and wheezed without a cold (odds ratio 6.8 [3.314.0]) during follow-up. Those sensitized and exposed to cockroach (Bla g I or 2 greater than or equal to 2 U/g) were at least three times more likely to have used steroid and to have attended a hospital emergency room; the size of the effect upon steroid use was maintained, but the precision was reduced and the 95% confidence interval included one (p = 0.07), with adjustment for race and poverty. We conclude that cockroach and cat allergens may contribute to asthma morbidity in sensitized women.

It was hypothesised that these workers would have a neutrophilic rather than an eosinophilic airway inflammatory response. Methods: Thirty eight consecutive workers with occupational asthma induced by low molecular weight agents underwent sputum induction and assessment of airway physiology while still exposed at work. Results: Only 14 (36.8%) of the 38 workers had sputum eosinophilia (>2.2%). Both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic groups had sputum neutrophilia (mean (SD) 59.5 (19.6)% and 55.1 (18.8)%, respectively). The diurnal variation and magnitude of fall in PEF during work periods was not significantly different between workers with and without sputum eosinophilia. Those with eosinophilia had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; 61.4% v 83% predicted, mean difference 21.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2 to 34.1 p=0.001) and greater methacholine reactivity (geometric mean PD20 253 mug v 1401 mug, p=0.007), hey also had greater bronchodilator reversibility (397 ml v 161 ml, mean difference 236, 95% Cl of difference 84 to 389, p=0.003) which was unrelated to differences in baseline FEV1. The presence of sputum eosinophilia did not relate to the causative agent, duration of exposure, atopy, or lack of treatment. Conclusions: Asthma caused by low molecular weight agents can be separated into eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic pathophysiological variants with the latter predominating. Both groups had evidence of sputum neutrophilia. Sputum eosinophilia was associated with more severe disease and greater bronchodilator reversibility but no difference in PEF response to work exposure.

Asthma is a major cause of morbidity that disproportionately affects inner-city children. For children with persistent asthma, defined as having asthma symptoms 3 or more days per week or 3 or more nights per month, national guidelines recommend the use of daily antiinflammatory agents. Despite these recommendations, antiinflammatory agents remain underused, particularly in inner-city children with high asthma morbidity. Objectives. The objectives of our study were to determine: 1) whether persistent asthma symptoms in inner-city children are related to acute care utilization and to the frequency of acute exacerbations; 2) whether children with persistent asthma are receiving recommended daily antiinflammatory agents; and 3) whether antiinflammatory medication use relates to sociodemographic factors, caretaker self-efficacy, the frequency of primary care visits, and/or measures of quality asthma care. Design and Methods. A 64-item telephone survey was administered between July 1996 and June 1997 to 219 parental caretakers of 2- to 12-year-old children who had been hospitalized with asthma at an inner-city medical center between January 1995 and February 1996. Persistent asthma symptoms were assessed by inquiring about the frequency of daily and nocturnal asthma symptoms over the last 4 weeks. Children's asthma severity was classified by applying the 1997 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Asthma Guidelines' severity classification scheme based on the frequency of asthma symptoms. Asthma morbidity was defined as the frequency of acute asthma exacerbations, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Daily antiinflammatory medication use was compared by sociodemographic factors, caretaker self-efficacy, frequency of primary care visits, and measures of quality asthma home management. Results. In this sample, quantifying persistent asthma symptoms and applying the NAEPP symptom criteria identified 17% of the children with mild intermittent asthma, 27% with mild persistent asthma and 56% with moderate to severe persistent asthma. There were no differences in the age of the children in the 3 groups (mean age: 6 years). Asthma morbidity, as measured by the number of asthma exacerbations in the last 6 months, was significantly higher in the children with moderate to severe persistent asthma compared with children with mild intermittent asthma (9.8 vs 3.5) or mild persistent asthma (9.8 vs 4.5). In addition, there were significantly more emergency department visits in the moderate to severe group than in the mild persistent (3.05 vs 1.69) or mild intermittent group (3.05 vs 1.76). Lastly, as asthma symptom frequency increased, there were trends toward more hospitalizations and more days hospitalized. Overall, 35% of the 219 families reported giving daily antiinflammatory medications to their child (mostly cromolyn sodium). Of the 181 children (83%) who met NA-EPP symptom criteria for persistent asthma, only 39% were receiving daily antiinflammatory treatment. Of the children with symptoms of moderate to severe asthma, only 15% were receiving inhaled steroids in contrast to the guidelines' recommendations. Use of antiinflammatory agents was not related to caretaker sociodemographic factors or self-efficacy scores. Measures of quality asthma home management, which included use of mattress covers, written plans, and peak flow meters, correlated positively with use of antiinflammatory agents. Children whose families reported using daily antiinflammatory medications had more primary care visits in the last 6 months than those children not receiving antiinflammatory medications. Conclusion. Questioning parents about the frequency of their child's asthma symptoms is an important, inexpensive, and readily accessible bedside and office tool that may aid in the detection of persistent symptoms and help direct therapy. Our study suggests that classifying asthma severity by quantifying persistent asthma symptoms, as defined in the NAEPP Guidelines, is a clinically useful tool that relates to asthma morbidity. In our sample of previously hospitalized children with asthma, 83% met 1997 NAEPP symptom criteria for persistent asthma, and yet only 35% were receiving daily antiinflammatory agents. Use of antiinflammatory agents correlated positively with other indicators of quality asthma home management. Additional work is necessary to increase appropriate use of antiinflammatory agents in this population, and in particular, to increase inhaled steroid use for children with moderate or severe symptoms.

In atopic dermatitis, there is so far little information about the effect of house dust mite elimination strategies. Objectives We therefore performed a randomized controlled study of house dust mite control in patients with this disease. Methods Twenty adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were included. Inclusion criteria were a positive RAST to house dust mite antigen (CAP class > 3) and a concentration of > 2 mug g(-1) of the house dust mite antigen Der p1 in the patient's mattress dust. Patients were randomized to either the active treatment group (allergen-impermeable mattress encasing, acaricide spray containing tannic acid and benzylbenzoate) or a control group (allergen-permeable encasing, spray containing water and traces of ethanol). Severity of disease was estimated every 2 months by an established score (SCORAD), and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in the serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, the use of topical steroids was quantified. Patients assessed daytime pruritus and pruritus-induced sleeplessness weekly on a visual analogue scale. The study lasted 1 year. Results At the end of the study, the active treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in Der p1 exposure as compared with the control group. However, when comparing the change from the start to the end of the study, there was no statistically significant difference between active treatment and control groups as measured by the SCORAD score and by ECP levels in the serum. Some patients in the active treatment group reported less pruritus-induced sleeplessness, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups. Conclusions For adult patients with atopic dermatitis it was shown that 1 year of house dust mite avoidance reduced the allergen exposure, but an improvement of overall disease activity was not demonstrated.

The cause of this disorder is not fully understood, although it is frequently the first sign of atopic disease and is characterized by an elevated serum IgE level, eosinophilia, and histologic tissue changes characterized early by spongiosis and a CD4(+) T(H)2 cellular infiltrate. Hypersensitivity to foods has been implicated as one causative factor in up to 40% of children with moderate-to-severe AD. Objective: The purpose of this study was to establish a murine model of food-induced AD. Methods: Female C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized orally to cow's milk or peanut with a cholera toxin adjuvant and then subjected to low-grade allergen exposure. Histologic examination of skin lesions, allergen-specific serum Ig levels, and allergen-induced T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were examined. Results: An eczematous eruption developed in approximately one third of mice after low-grade exposure to milk or peanut proteins. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels were noted. Histologic examination of the Lesional skin revealed spongiosis and a cellular infiltrate consisting of CD4(+) lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells, IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression was elevated only in the skin of mice with the eczematous eruption. Treatment of the eruption with topical corticosteroids led to decreased pruritus and resolution of the cutaneous eruption. Conclusion: This eczematous eruption resembles AD in human subjects and should provide a useful model for studying immunopathogenic mechanisms of food hypersensitivity in AD.

The purpose of this study was to examine certain exposures in the home environment and the risk of adult-onset asthma. Methods: A nested case-referent study of adult-onset asthma was performed in a random population sample (n = 15 813), aged 20-50 years. Cases for the study included subjects reporting "physician-diagnosed" asthma (n = 174). The referents (n = 870) were randomly selected from the whole population sample. The case-referent sample was investigated with a comprehensive mailed questionnaire about exposures in the home environment, asthma, respiratory symptoms, smoking habits, and atopy. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated while controlling for age, sex, smoking, and atopy. Results: Increased adjusted OR for asthma were associated with exposure to molds (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), environmental tobacco smoke (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.1), and the presence of a wood stove (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5). Conclusions: This population-based case-referent study indicates that self-reported domestic exposures to molds or environmental tobacco smoke can be associated with adult-onset asthma.

Germination of spores has been suggested to increase allergen release. This study examined allergen released from individual spores and the effect of germination on allergen availability. Allergen release was determined with the Halogen (Inhalix, Sydney, Australia) immunoassay, by use of serum IgE from Alternaria-sensitized subjects and 3 Alt a 1-specific antibodies. Not all spores released allergen. Germination of the spores significantly increased the proportion that released allergen (P < .0001 for all antibodies). Alt a 1 may be a minor contributor to the total allergen released from spores except when spores have germinated.

Before aerosol challenge, all three monkeys skin-tested positive for HDMA, During aerosol challenge with HDMA, sensitized monkeys exhibited cough and rapid shallow breathing and increased airway resistance,which was reversed by albuterol aerosol treatment. Compared to nonsensitized monkeys, there was a fourfold reduction in the dose of histamine aerosol necessary to produce a 150% increase in airway resistance in sensitized monkeys, After aerosol challenge, serum levels of histamine were elevated in sensitized monkeys, Sensitized monkeys exhibited increased levels of HDMA-specific IgE in serum, numbers of eosinophils and exfoliated cells within lavage, and elevated CD25 expression on circulating CD4(+) lymphocytes, Intrapulmonary bronchi of sensitized monkeys had focal mucus tell hyperplasia, interstitial infiltrates of eosinophils, and thickening of the basement membrane zone, We conclude that a model of allergic asthma can be induced in rhesus monkeys using a protocol consisting of subcutaneous injection, intranasal instillation, and aerosol challenge with HDMA.

From the Occupational Injury Information System in Sweden, as well as from registers of industrial injuries in other countries, it is evident that females report skin disease more often than males. Epidemiological studies of hand eczema also show that women are more often affected than men, in particular young women. The most common type of hand eczema is irritant contact dermatitis, which is often caused by wet work. Many female-dominated occupations involve extensive wet work, e.g., hairdressing, catering, cleaning and health-care work. These occupations are also high-risk occupations for hand eczema. Experimental studies of skin irritation have not confirmed differences between the sexes; thus, the higher prevalence of irritant contact dermatitis among females is most likely due to exposure, occupational and non-occupational. Nickel allergy is the most common contact allergy, which is most frequent in young females, and in 30-40% results over time in hand eczema. Hand eczema has an impact on quality of life and females seem to report a higher degree of discomfort than males. To achieve the optimal effect of preventive efforts regarding occupational skin disease, the focus for prevention should aim at reducing wet exposure.

This study was undertaken to determine whether tuberculin reactivity is inversely related to atopy in young adults vaccinated with BCG at the age of 14. Methods-Men and women aged 20-44 years were tested using the adrenaline-Pirquet test with Norwegian produced synthetic medium tuberculin (n = 891). In addition, their serum total and specific IgE antibodies against mite, cat, timothy grass, mould and birch were measured. Results-Of the 574 subjects with complete examinations, 64% had a positive adrenaline-Pirquet tuberculin test (greater than or equal to 4 mm) and 27% exhibited IgE antibodies (greater than or equal to 0.35 kU/l) to one or more of the five specific allergens. The geometric mean of total serum IgE in the population was 30.2 kU/l. Tuberculin reactivity and log IgE were not correlated (r = 0.043, p 0.30). The mean tuberculin reactivity was 4.6 mm, 4.9 mm, and 5.0 mm in the lower, middle and upper tertile of IgE distribution (< 14 kU/l, 14-61 kU/l, > 61 kU/l). The prevalence of atopy, as assessed by either the presence of any of the five specific IgE antibodies or by each specific IgE antibody separately, did not differ between subjects with a positive and those with a negative tuberculin test. These results persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking status in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusions-In this young adult population, BCG vaccinated at the age of 14, no significant relationship between a positive tuberculin reaction and atopy was observed. If a true relationship had been found, our study suggests that it may be limited to populations immunised in early childhood when a substantial modulation of the immune system can occur.

Immunohistochemistry on frozen sections of bronchial biopsies were obtained at bronchoscopy in 11 nonsmokers, eight asymptomatic smokers and 11 smokers with chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There was an increase in the number of CD8+ cells infiltrating the bronchial subepithelium in the COPD group compared to the asymptomatic smokers (305 (109-400) versus 92 (41-550) cells.mm(-2), p=0.030). There was a negative correlation between the number of CD8+ cells and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) %predicted (p=0.005, r=-0.62), and a positive correlation between the number of CD8+ cells and the number of pack years smoked (p=0.017, r=0.42). There was a negative correlation between the activated/total eosinophils ratio and the FEV1 % pred (p=0.017, r=-0.51). There was a negative correlation between pack years smoked and the number of neutrophils (p=0.022, r=-0.36). Smokers who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells in large airways when compared to asymptomatic smokers. Airway obstruction was associated with an increase in the proportion of eosinophils that were activated.

Dendritic cells and airway epithelial cells at the interface between innate and adaptive immune responses	ALLERGY			English	Review						allergens; asthma; dendritic cells; epithelium	HOUSE-DUST MITE; THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; REGULATORY T-CELLS; HELPER TYPE-2 RESPONSE; BRONCHIAL LYMPH-NODE; IN-VIVO; ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION; INHALED ANTIGEN; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; TH2 RESPONSES	P>Because they can recognize and sample inhaled allergens, dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of adaptive Th2 responses in asthma. It is increasingly clear that DC functions are strongly influenced by a crosstalk with neighboring cells like epithelial cells. Whereas the epithelium was initially considered only as a barrier, it is now seen as a central player in controlling the function of lung DCs through release of innate cytokines-promoting Th2 responses. Clinically relevant allergens, as well as known environmental and genetic risk factors for allergy and asthma, often interfere directly or indirectly with the innate immune functions of airway epithelial cells and DC. A better understanding of these interactions might lead to a better prevention and ultimately to new treatments for asthma.

Non-response; Epidemiology	POSTAL SURVEY; RISK-FACTORS; YOUNG-ADULTS; SYMPTOMS; ASTHMA; PREVALENCE; POPULATION; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; COHORT	Background: Participation rates in epidemiologic studies conducted with postal questionnaires have steadily declined since 1970s. This can lead to an increased risk for selection bias. The aim of this study was to examine cause and effect of non-response in a large cross sectional study assessing respiratory health in western Sweden. Methods: The study sample was 29,218. The response rate to the initial postal. questionnaire was 33%. The response rates to subsequent postal reminders were 15%, 7% and 7% of eligible participants totalling a participation of 62%. Of those who did not respond to the postal survey, a random sample of 400 subjects were identified and contacted for interview by telephone. Results: Non-responders did not differ significantly in prevalence of airway diseases or symptoms when compared with responders. Mate sex, young age and smokers were underestimated among non-responders. No clear trends in prevalence of respiratory symptoms and report of asthma were found with delayed response to the postal. survey. The proportion of smokers and men increased with increasing number of reminders. Letters reminding subjects about the study did increase the participation rate but did not alter the risk estimates. Conclusion: We conclude that with a response rate of 62%, our estimate of disease and symptom prevalence was not biased in this Swedish population. However, smoking was underestimated. No general. trend for late-responders was seen and therefore we conclude that extrapolation of results to non-responders is not possible in our study. Causes of non-response were mainly due to circumstantial factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: FLG mutations R501X, 2282del4 and R2447X were genotyped in the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth cohort (n = 934) to evaluate longitudinally, for up to 8 years, their association with eczema, sensitization, asthma, hay fever and their interaction with cat exposure. Results: The combined FLG mutations were significantly associated with eczema at all ages when occurring in the first year of life (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4-2.8). Combined FLG mutations were associated with both atopic and nonatopic eczema, as well as asthma (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.8-7.5). When the FLG 2282del4 mutation was analysed separately, it was significantly associated with the development of eczema during the first year, having eczema up to 8 years and sensitization at the age of 8 years, which was enhanced by early-life cat exposure (ORs being 8.2; 95% CI: 2.6-25.9, 6.0; 95% CI: 3.2-11.3 and 5.4; 95% CI: 1.2-23.6 respectively). FLG 2282del4 was significantly associated with hay fever from the age 5 years onwards (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.5-10.5). Conclusions: FLG mutations are associated both with atopic and nonatopic eczema starting in the first year of life. FLG mutations combined with eczema in the first year of life are associated with a later development of asthma and hay fever, a clear example of the atopic march. We confirm that cat exposure enhances the effect of a FLG mutation on the development of eczema and sensitization.	[Schuttelaar, M. L. A.; Jonkman, M.

However, little is known about the sources of different microbes. A better understanding of the nature and origin of microbes present in the immediate environment of human beings is crucial if one wants to elucidate protective as well as adverse effects on human health. Objective: To determine the extent to which the bacterial composition of mattress and floor dust reflects the presence of the human body in relation to other environmental sources. Methods: House dust and skin surface swab samples of occupants in 4 homes were collected and analyzed for their bacterial content, using a culture-independent methodology. Bacterial sequences analyzed from the different house dusts and skin surface swabs represented random samples of bacteria present in a given sample. Highly similar sequences were grouped to assess biodiversity and to draw conclusions about the sources of bacteria. Results: The bacterial flora in the house dust samples was found to be highly diverse and dominated by gram-positive bacteria. To a considerable extent, the presence of different bacterial groups was attributed to human sources. In the individuals' mattress dust samples, 69% to 88% of the bacterial sequences analyzed were associated with human origins. The respective percentages for the individual floor dusts ranged from 45% to 55%. Conclusion: Our study indicates that human-derived bacteria account for a large part of the mainly gram-positive bacterial content in house dust. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;124:834-40.)

Recent findings Recent population-based studies have shown the prevalence of wheat allergy and sensitization more precisely than past studies among small populations and in hospital settings. Intensive research has demonstrated the diverse profile of both water/salt-soluble and insoluble allergens involved in clinical types of wheat allergies determined depending on the patient age, the sensitization route, and the protein state during the exposure. Consequently, some new allergens, including nonspecific lipid transfer protein (Tri a 14), have been identified. For diagnosis, the role of water/salt-insoluble gliadins, particularly omega-5 gliadin, a major allergen of wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, was assessed as compared with the results of oral challenges. The mechanisms of eliciting anaphylactic symptoms by exercise in wheat-de pendent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis were speculated upon; one is the allergenicity strengthened by activated tissue transglutaminase and another is the increased absorption of allergens through the gastrointestinal tract.

Loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) were identified as risk factors for eczema and associated asthma. Objective: We evaluated the utility of the FLG mutations for the prediction of asthma. Methods: Eight hundred seventy-one individuals of the prospective German Multicenter Allergy Study cohort were genotyped for 3 FLG mutations. Information on asthma, eczema, and food sensitization was available from birth to 13 years of age. Pulmonary function was measured from 7 to 13 years of age. The predictive value of the FLG mutations and of atopic phenotypes in infancy was assessed for asthma. Results: In infants with eczema and sensitization to food allergens, the FLG mutations predicted childhood asthma with a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 65.5% to 100%). This subgroup was characterized by a significant decrease in pulmonary function until puberty and represented 8.1% of all asthmatic children and 19.1% of patients with asthma after infantile eczema. We found a strong synergistic interaction between the FLG-null alleles and early food sensitization in the disease transition from eczema to asthma (relative excess risk due to interaction, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.70-3.98; P = .00040). Conclusion: FLG mutations and food sensitization represent 2 distinct mechanisms interacting in the pathogenesis of asthma. In infants with eczema and food sensitization, genotyping of the FLG mutations allows the prediction of asthma before the onset of symptoms. Our findings might facilitate the development of early subgroup-specific interventions to prevent the progression from eczema to asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;123:911-6.)

Early introduction of fish decreases the risk of eczema in infants	ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD			English	Article							ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; BIRTH COHORT; 1ST YEAR; INTESTINAL MICROFLORA; ALLERGY DEVELOPMENT; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; LIFE; SENSITIZATION; ASSOCIATION	Background: Atopic eczema in infants has increased in western societies. Environmental factors and the introduction of food may affect the risk of eczema. Aims: To investigate the prevalence of eczema among infants in western Sweden, describe patterns of food introduction and assess risk factors for eczema at 1 year of age. Methods: Data were obtained from a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of infants born in western Sweden in 2003; 8176 families were randomly selected and, 6 months after the infant's birth, were invited to participate and received questionnaires. A second questionnaire was sent out when the infants were 12 months old. Both questionnaires were completed and medical birth register data were obtained for 4921 infants (60.2% of the selected population). Results: At 1 year of age, 20.9% of the infants had previous or current eczema. Median age at onset was 4 months. In multivariable analysis, familial occurrence of eczema, especially in siblings (OR 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.33) or the mother (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.84), remained an independent risk factor. Introducing fish before 9 months of age (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) and having a bird in the home (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75) were beneficial. Conclusions: One in five infants suffer from eczema during the first year of life. Familial eczema increased the risk, while early fish introduction and bird keeping decreased it.

The recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung following cigarette smoke exposure presents a risk of tissue damage through the release of toxic mediators, including proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species. This review represents a toxicological approach to investigation of cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, with a focus on laboratory studies and an emphasis on inflammatory mechanisms. The studies discussed in this review analyze the role of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in the development of injury. In cases where information relating to cigarette smoke is limited, examples are taken from other models of lung injury applicable to cigarette smoke. The primary aim of the review is to summarize published work so as to permit (1) an evaluation of chronic lung injury and inflammatory responses in animal models, (2) a discussion of inflammatory mediators in the development of chronic injury, and (3) identification of immunological mechanisms of injury. These studies discuss the currently understood roles of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and oxidative stress in inflammatory reactions and lung injury. A role for lipocortin 1 (annexin 1), a naturally occurring defense factor against inflammation, is discussed because of the possibility that impaired synthesis and degradation of lipocortin 1 will influence immune responses in animals exposed to cigarette smoke either by augmenting T helper cell Th1 response or by shifting Th1 to Th2 response. While Th1 augmentation will increase the risk for development of emphysema, Th1 to Th2 shift will favor development of asthma.

Objectives: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various components of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in a large group of children with asthma. Methods: A total of 164 children with mild asthma and 173 healthy children were included in the study. Levels of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were measured by using ELISA, whereas reduced glutathione, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, lycopene, beta-carotene, amino acids participating in glutathione synthesis, and amino acids susceptible to oxidation were measured by HPLC. All comparisons were adjusted for atopy, body mass index, smoke exposure, and pet ownership. Results: Levels of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and of the nonenzymatic components of the antioxidant system including reduced glutathione, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, lycopene, and beta-carotene were significantly lower in children with asthma compared with healthy controls (P <.001 for each). Of the amino acids contributing to glutathione synthesis, glycine and glutamine were significantly lower in children with asthma (P <.001). The majority of the amino acid susceptible to oxidative stress displayed lower levels in children with asthma (P <.05). Conclusion: Childhood asthma is associated with significant decreases in various components of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses.

The effect of sandstorms and air pollution on cause-specific hospital admissions in Taipei, Taiwan	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							DUST STORM EVENTS; DAILY STROKE ADMISSIONS; LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT; DAILY MORTALITY; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; AMBIENT AIR; PARTICLES; QUALITY; PARTICULATE; KAOHSIUNG	Objective: Relatively little research exists focusing on the impact of air pollution on hospital admissions in Asia compared to the extensive work conducted in the USA and Europe. The issue is of particular importance because of the frequency, intensity and health effects of Asian sandstorms. This work investigates the relation between cause-specific hospital admissions and sandstorms and air pollution in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. Methods: Time-series analyses of asthma, pneumonia, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease hospital admissions were performed for Taipei. An eight-year time period (1995-2002) was considered for various indicators of sandstorms and the pollutants NO2, CO, ozone, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5. Pollution effects based on single-day lags of 0, 1, 2 and 3 days were explored, along with the average of the same day and previous three days (L03). Results: The risk of ischaemic heart disease admissions was associated with several sandstorm metrics, including indicators of high PM10 levels in the Taipei area, indicators of high PM10 at a monitor designed to measure background pollution, the PM coarse fraction, and the ratio of PM10 to PM2.5. However, the lag structure of effect was not consistent across sandstorm indicators. Hospital admissions for this disease were 16-21% higher on sandstorm days compared to other days. This cause was also associated with transportation-related pollutants, NO2, CO and PM2.5. Asthma admissions rose 4.48% (95% CI 0.71% to 8.38%) per 28 mu g/m(3) increase in L03 PM10 levels and 7.60% (95% CI 2.87% to 12.54%) per 10 ppb increase in L03 ozone. Cerebrovascular disease admissions were associated with PM10 and CO, both at lag 3 days. SO2 exhibited no relation with admissions. Conclusions: Risk of hospital admissions in Taipei may be increased by air pollution and sandstorms. Additional research is needed to clarify the lag structure and magnitude of such effects.

Exhaled nitric oxide in childhood asthma: a review	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY			English	Review							PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA; BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS SYNDROME; EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION; RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; AIRWAY EPITHELIAL-CELLS; GRASS-POLLEN EXPOSURE; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; LUNG-FUNCTION; HEALTHY-CHILDREN	As an 'inflammometer', the fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled air (FENO) is increasingly used in the management of paediatric asthma. FENO provides us with valuable, additional information regarding the nature of underlying airway inflammation, and complements lung function testing and measurement of airway hyper-reactivity. This review focuses on clinical applications of FENO in paediatric asthma. First, FENO provides us with a practical tool to aid in the diagnosis of asthma and distinguish patients who will benefit from inhaled corticosteroids from those who will not. Second, FENO is helpful in predicting exacerbations, and predicting successful steroid reduction or withdrawal. In atopic asthmatic children FENO is beneficial in adjusting steroid doses, discerning those patients who require additional therapy from those whose medication dose could feasibly be reduced. In pre-school children FENO may be of help in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms, and may potentially allow for better targeting and monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, a clinical syndrome that results from the failure of the normal fetal-to-neonatal circulatory transition, is associated with substantial infant mortality and morbidity. We performed a case-control study to determine possible antenatal and perinatal predictors of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Methods. Between 1998 and 2003, the Slone Epidemiology Center enrolled 377 mothers of infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and 836 mothers of matched control subjects. Within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interviewed participants regarding demographic, medical, and obstetric characteristics. Results. Factors that were independently associated with an elevated risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn were infant male gender and black or Asian maternal race compared with white race. High prepregnancy BMI (> 27 vs < 20) was also associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, as were diabetes and asthma. Compared with infants who were delivered vaginally, the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn was higher for those who were born by cesarean section. Compared with infants who were born within 37 to 41 gestational weeks, the risk was higher for those who were born between 34 and 37 completed weeks and for those born beyond 41 weeks. Compared with infants within the 10th and 90th percentiles of birth weight for gestational age distribution, the risk was higher for infants above the 90th percentile. Conclusions. Our findings suggest an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn associated with cesarean delivery; late preterm or postterm birth; being large for gestational age; and maternal black or Asian race, overweight, diabetes, and asthma. It remains unclear whether some of these factors are direct causes of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn or simply share common causes with it; however, clinicians should be alert to the increased need for monitoring and intervention among pregnancies with these risk factors.

It is still unclear whether this measurement could be associated with disease severity or apply to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A wide range of results, at baseline or after therapeutic intervention, have been reported using different measurement methods. Objective: To determine whether increased RBM thickness could be associated specifically with severe asthma and in COPD in large samples. Methods: We blindly measured RBM thickness in endobronchial biopsies from 50 patients with severe asthma (mean age, 53 years; FEV1 66% predicted, inhaled steroids >= 1500 mu g and 20 mg daily dose of oral corticosteroids, lifelong nonsmokers), 50 untreated patients with mild asthma mean age, 33 years; FEV, 93%pred, lifelong nonsmokers), 50 patients with COPD (mean age, 57 years; FEV1 53%pred, all current smokers), and 18 control subjects using 2 different validated quantitative and computer-assisted methods (repeated multiple point-to-point vs area by length ratio). Results: Reticular basement membrane thickness was higher in severe asthma compared with mild asthma and COPD (P =.0053). On the basis of receiver operating characteristic curves, RBM thickness was effective in differentiating severe asthma from other groups (sensitivity and specificity, 98% and 95%, respectively, above a threshold of 5 mu m vs control, 70% and 75% at 7 mu m vs mild, 83% and 68% at 6 mu m vs COPD). Conclusion: Increased RBM thickness was specifically associated with severe asthma, whereas surprisingly, COPD and mild asthma had similar remodeling features. Clinical implications: Reticular basement membrane thickness can be considered a hallmark of severe asthma.

Comparison of airway remodeling in acute, subacute, and chronic models of allergic airways disease	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						asthma; fibrosis; inflammation; mice	MURINE MODEL; MOUSE MODEL; EXPERIMENTAL ASTHMA; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; BRONCHIAL-ASTHMA; ATOPIC ASTHMA; ANIMAL-MODELS; INFLAMMATION; FIBROSIS; EXPRESSION	The relationship between airway inflammation and structural changes of airway remodeling, and their relative effects on airway function, are poorly understood. Remodeling is thought to result from chronic repetitive injury to the airway wall caused by airway inflammation; however, the mechanisms regulating remodeling changes have not been clearly defined. We examined the sequence of events in remodeling using three commonly used mouse models of allergic airways disease in which mice are exposed to nebulized ovalbumin for four consecutive days (acute), seven consecutive days (subacute), or three times a week for 6 wk (chronic). Surprisingly, we found that a very short period of exposure to ovalbumin was sufficient to elicit early changes of remodeling. Goblet cell hyperplasia and epithelial thickening were evident after just 4 d. In chronically challenged mice, these changes persisted and, in addition, subepithelial Collagen deposition was significantly increased. This Collagen deposition was associated with a failure to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase (MIMP)-2, in conjunction with increased transforming growth factor-beta and MMP-9 expression. The relationship between inflammation, remodeling changes, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were examined. The acute and subacute models exhibited marked airway inflammation, whereas the chronic model had very modest inflammation. Conversely, airway fibrosis was only evident in the chronic model. AHR was present in all three models; however, it was significantly higher in the chronic model compared with the acute (P < 0.05) and subacute (P < 0.05) models. These data demonstrate that both airway inflammation and airway fibrosis may contribute to AHR, with airway fibrosis leading to the greatest increases in AHR.

Homologues of CA are being widely promoted in surgery as a tissue adhesive to replace traditional suturing techniques. Potential benefits of using CA adhesives include better cosmetic results, more rapid wound closure, and perhaps most significantly, the potential for significant reductions in percutaneous injuries from suture needles, which would in turn also reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, certain concerns have been raised regarding the potential toxicity of CA within patients, as well as among health professionals who are occupationally exposed when using CA compounds. Reported toxicity of CA in the workplace may result in dermatological, allergic and respiratory conditions. To help reduce the occupational burden, therefore, medical staff using CA adhesives should avoid direct contact with the compound and use appropriate personal protective measures at all times. Maintaining higher levels of humidity, optimizing room ventilation and using special air conditioning filters in surgical suites and operating theatres may also be useful in minimizing the exposure to volatile CA adhesives.

Computed tomographic indices of lung density are assumed to reflect air trapping and may be a useful noninvasive measure of small airways disease, but their pathophysiological relevance remains undetermined. Objective: To evaluate lung density on high-resolution computed tomography and examine its correlations with clinical and physiologic variables in 29 patients with stable asthma. Methods: Both lungs were scanned at full-inspiratory and fullexpiratory phases to quantify percentage of lung field occupied by low attenuation area (LAA%; < -960 Hounsfield units) and mean lung density. Asthma severity, pulmonary function, methacholine airway sensitivity and reactivity, and sputum eosinophil counts were evaluated. Results: The mean lung density increased and LAA% decreased in all patients at expiratory phase compared with inspiratory phase. The inspiratory density indices and expiratory mean lung density correlated only with FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC). Expiratory LAA% correlated more strongly than other variables with FEV1/FVC and with indices of peripheral airflow obstruction. Expiratory/inspiratory ratios of LAA% and mean lung density correlated, the former more strongly, with disease severity, residual volume/total lung capacity, and airway sensitivity, as well as with indices of global (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) and peripheral airflow obstruction. Conclusion: Expiratory/inspiratory high-resolution computed tomography is useful for assessing small airways disease in asthma. Small airways involvement is associated with airflow obstruction, airway hypersensitivity, and more severe disease. Clinical implications: Small airways are an important therapeutic target in asthma.

The clinical and immunologic effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in children with asthma caused by mites were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for 6 months. Patients (aged 6-12 yr) with mild-to-moderate asthma, with single sensitization to mite allergen, received either SLIT or placebo with a standardized Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D.p.)/D. farinae (D.f.) 50/50 extract. The cumulative dose was around 41824 IR, equivalent to 1.7 mg of D.p. and 3.0 mg of D.f. allergen. Symptom and medication scores were assessed throughout the study. Serum total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, eosinophil count, eosinophil cationic protein, specific IgE, specific IgG4, and skin sensitivity were evaluated before starting the treatment and after the treatment period. Twenty patients completed the study. At the beginning of the treatment, no differences were observed between the groups for symptom and medication scores, skin sensitivity, or immunologic parameters. After 6 months of treatment, there was a significant difference in nighttime asthma symptom scores and specific IgG4 (p < 0.05) in the SLIT group compared with the placebo group. Daytime symptom and medication scores, total IgE, eosinophil count, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and mean evening peak expiratory flow rate reached significant differences in the SLIT group during the treatment period (p < 0.05). No severe adverse effects were reported. Our results revealed that treatment for 6 months with SLIT is clinically effective in decreasing asthmatic symptoms and medication use in children with mild-to-moderate asthma because of mite sensitivity. The clinical usefulness of this form of immunotherapy and the mechanism underlying its immunologic effects deserve further studies.

When the interaction between innate and adaptive immunity is disturbed, pathological conditions such as asthma can develop. It was the aim of the study to investigate the effect of the allergic inflammation of the lung on the innate host defense during bacterial infection. Human bronchial epithelial cells were preinculvated with Th2 cytokines and infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of the Th2 cytokines on the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides and the antimicrobial activity of HBEC was determined. To investigate the influence of an allergic inflammation on pulmonary host defense in vivo, mice sensitized and challenged with OVA were infected with P. aeruginosa, and the number of viable bacteria in the lungs was determined together with markers of inflammation like cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. Exposure of airway epithelial cells to Th2 cytokines resulted in a significantly decreased antimicrobial activity of the cells and in suppressed mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2. Furthermore, mice with allergic airway inflammation had significantly more viable bacteria in their lungs after infection. This was consistent with reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and of the antimicrobial peptide cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide. These results show that an allergic airway inflammation suppresses the innate antimicrobial host defense. The adaptive immune system modulates the functions of the pulmonary innate immune system.

Pro-oxidative diesel exhaust particle chemicals inhibit LPS-induced dendritic cell responses involved in T-helper differentiation	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						dendritic cells; T(H)1/T(H)2 cells; LPS; cell differentiation	NF-KAPPA-B; ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS; AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; DEPOSITION PATTERNS; HEME OXYGENASE-1; INHALED ANTIGEN; TH2 RESPONSES; MURINE MODEL; ACTIVATION	Background: Epidemiologic studies show that exposure to ambient particulate matter leads to asthma exacerbation. Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), a model pollutant, act as an adjuvant for allergic sensitization. Increasing evidence shows that this effect could be mediated by an effect on dendritic cells (DCs). Objective: Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism by which pro-oxidative DEP chemicals change DC function so that these antigen-presenting cells strengthen the immune response to an experimental allergen. Methods: We exposed murine bone marrow-derived DCs and a homogeneous myeloid DC line, BC1, to DEPs and organic extracts made from these particles to determine how the induction of oxidative stress affects cellular maturation, cytokine production, and activation of antigen-specific T cells. Results: DEP extracts induced oxidative stress in DCs. This change in redox equilibrium interfered in the ability of Toll-like receptor agonists to induce the expression of maturation receptors (eg, CD86, CD54, and I-A(d)) and IL-12 production. This perturbation of DC function was accompanied by decreased IFN-gamma and increased IL-10 induction in antigen-specific T cells. The molecular basis for the perturbation of DC function is the activation of a nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2-mediated signaling pathway that suppresses IL-12 production. NF-E2-related factor 2 deficiency abrogates the perturbation of DC function by DEPs. Conclusion: These data provide the first report that prooxidative DEP chemicals can interfere in T(H)1-promoting response pathways in a homogeneous DC population and provide a novel explanation for the adjuvant effect of DEPs on allergic inflammation.

A land use regression model for predicting ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; PERSONAL EXPOSURE; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; MAJOR HIGHWAY; URBAN AREA; CHILDREN; MORTALITY	This paper reports on the development of a land use regression (LUR) model for predicting the intraurban variation of traffic-related air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, an industrial city at the western end of Lake Ontario. Although land use regression has been increasingly used to characterize exposure gradients within cities, research to date has yet to test whether this method can produce reliable estimates in an industrialized location. Ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO,) were measured for a 2-week period in October 2002 at > 100 locations across the city and subsequently at 30 of these locations in May 2004 to assess seasonal effects. Predictor variables were derived for land use types, transportation, demography, and, physical geography using geographic information systems. The LUR model explained 76% of the variation in NO2. Traffic density, proximity to a highway, and industrial land use were all positively correlated with NO, concentrations, whereas open land use and distance from the lake were negatively correlated with NO2. Locations downwind of a major highway resulted in higher NO2 levels. Cross-validation of the results confirmed model stability Over different seasons. Our findings demonstrate that land use regression can effectively predict NO, variation at the intraurban scale in an industrial setting. Models predicting exposure within smaller areas may lead to improved detection of health effects in epidemiologic studies.

Our objective was to review the pathogenesis, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition. Methods: The current literature was reviewed using an Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed literature review for all studies published in the English language from 1963 to December 2004 using the medical subject heading term "eosinophilic bronchitis." Results: Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is a common cause of chronic cough. it is characterized by the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation, similar to that seen in asthma. However, in contrast to asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is not associated with variable airflow limitation or airway hyperresponsiveness. The differences in functional association are related to differences in the localization of mast cells within the airway wall, with airway smooth muscle infiltration occurring in patients with asthma, and epithelial infiltration in patients with nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Diagnosis is made by the confirmation of eosinophilic airway inflammation usually with induced sputum analysis after the exclusion of other causes for chronic cough on clinical, radiologic, and lung function assessment. The cough usually responds well to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The dose and duration of treatment differ between patients. The condition can be transient, episodic, or persistent unless treated, and occasionally patients may require long-term prednisone treatment. Conclusions: Further study of this condition may improve our understanding of airway inflammation and airway responsiveness, leading to novel targets for therapeutic agents for the treatment of both asthma and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

What is less well known is the fact that efficient activation of allergen-specific T cells upon low-dose exposure to allergens is critically dependent on IgE-mediated or -facilitated allergen presentation. In fact, changes in the level of IgE-mediated allergen presentation may account for many of the immunological effects described for specific immunotherapy or anti-IgE treatment. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge, and will discuss the clinical relevance of blocking IgG antibodies induced by specific immunotherapy and anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies that both interfere with IgE-mediated allergen presentation.

However, little work has been done to demonstrate the presence of these compounds in such environments. The presence of airborne macrocyclic trichothecene mycotoxins in indoor environments with known Stachybotrys chartarum contamination was therefore investigated. In seven buildings, air was collected using a high-volume liquid impaction bioaerosol sampler (SpinCon PAS 450-10) under static or disturbed conditions. An additional building was sampled using an Andersen GPS-1 PUF sampler modified to separate and collect particulates smaller than conidia. Four control buildings (i.e., no detectable S. chartarum growth or history of water damage) and outdoor air were also tested. Samples were analyzed using a macrocyclic trichothecene-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA specificity was tested using phosphate-buffered saline extracts of the fungal genera Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Memnoniella, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Trichoderma, five Stachybotrys strains, and the indoor air allergens Can f 1, Der p 1, and Fel d 1. For test buildings, the results showed that detectable toxin concentrations increased with the sampling time and short periods of air disturbance. Trichothecene values ranged from < 10 to > 1,300 pg/m(3) of sampled air. The control environments demonstrated statistically significantly (P < 0.001) lower levels of airborne trichothecenes. ELISA specificity experiments demonstrated a high specificity for the trichothecene-producing strain of S. chartarum. Our data indicate that airborne macrocyclic trichothecenes can exist in Stachybotrys-contaminated buildings, and this should be taken into consideration in future indoor air quality investigations.

They may adversely affect human health through allergy, infection, and toxicity. Moreover, they have a great influence on urban air quality in Beijing. In this study, a systematical survey on the culturable airborne fungi was carried out for I year in Beijing urban area. Fungal samples were collected for 3 min, three times each day, and continued for three consecutive days of each month with FA-1 sampler from three sampling sites. Results showed that the culturable fungal concentrations ranged from 24 CFU (Colony forming units) /m(3) to 13960 CFU/m(3), and the mean and median was 1165 CFU/m(3) and 710 CFU/m(3), respectively. Fungal concentrations in the greener area around the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) and Beijing Botanical Garden (BBG) were significantly higher than in the densely urban and highly trafficked area of Xizhimen (XZM) (***P < 0.001), but no significant difference was found between RCEES and BBG (P > 0.05). The variation of fungal concentrations in different seasons was significant in RCEES and BBG, where the concentrations were higher in Summer and Autumn, and lower in Spring and Winter. However, there were no significant differences in fungal concentrations between the Spring and the Winter for three sampling sites (P > 0.05). Fourteen genera, including 40 species of culturable fungi, were identified in this study. Penicillium, with the most abundant species, which comprised more than 50% of the total isolated fungal species. Cladosporium were the most dominant fungal group, and contributed to more than one third of the total fungal concentration, followed by non-sporing isolates, Alternaria, Pencillium and Asperigillus. The concentration percentage of Cladosporium was significantly higher in RCEES than in XZM (*P < 0.05), and the concentration percentages of Penicillium (**P < 0.01) and Aspergillus (*P < 0.05) were higher in XZM than in RCEES and in BBG. For other groups' concentration percentages, no significant differences were observed among the sampling sites.

Recent findings Several gene polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to asthma and allergy; complex gene-environmental interactions, however, appear to play a key role in the development of the disease. Early life sensitization to aeroallergens, presence of atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis, maternal smoking during pregnancy and children's environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, lower respiratory tract infections with respiratory syncytial virus and potentially with other viruses including rhinovirus and metapneumovirus, exposure to air pollutants, several perinatal factors other than maternal smoking, are among factors associated with an increased risk for development of chronic asthma. Summary The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases is increasing progressively. Those who are involved in the care of young children should be prepared to recognize risk factors for development of these diseases and to appreciate the role of gene-environment interactions. Preventive measures established at an early age may modify the natural history of asthma and other allergic diseases.

The dust and smoke settled in the surrounding area, which encompassed a large residential community. We hypothesized that previously normal residents in the community surrounding the former WTC would have an increased incidence of persistent respiratory symptoms and abnormalities in screening spirometry. A hybrid cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study using a symptom-based questionnaire and onsite screening spirometry in residents in an exposed area and in a control area was performed 12 +/- 4 months after the collapse. Surveys were analyzed from 2,812 residents. New-onset respiratory symptoms were described by 55.8% of residents in the exposed area, compared with 20.1% in the control area after the event. Persistent new-onset symptoms were identified in 26.4 versus 7.5% of residents in the exposed area versus control area, respectively. No differences in screening spirometry between the groups were detected. A small pilot study suggested the possibility of an increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in exposed participants with persistent symptoms. The data demonstrate an increased rate of new-onset and persistent respiratory health effects in residents near the former WTC compared with a control population.

The application of molecular diagnostic methods has improved understanding of viral epidemiology and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in viral induced acute asthma. This article reviews publications since October 2002 for an update of the role of viruses in exacerbations of asthma. Recent findings Respiratory viruses are present in most patients hospitalized for life-threatening asthma and acute nonlife-threatening asthma. Rhinovirus is the most common, but coinfection with other viruses may be important. Patients with asthma are not more susceptible to upper respiratory tract rhinovirus infections than healthy people but suffer from more severe consequences of the lower respiratory tract infection. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that viruses provoke asthma attacks by additive or synergistic interactions with allergen exposure or with air pollution. An impaired antiviral immunity to rhinovirus may lead to impaired viral clearance and hence prolonged symptoms. Respiratory viral infections cause asthmatic exacerbations by triggering recruitment of T(H)2-type cells into the lungs, There is no specific antiviral strategy for prevention of respiratory-triggered asthma exacerbations, although clinical trials of potential antiviral agents are ongoing. Indirect prevention strategies focus on the reduction of overall airway inflammation to reduce the severity of the host response to respiratory viral infections. Summary Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in asthma. There is a lack of specific antiviral strategies in the prevention or reduction of viral-triggered asthma exacerbations. Recent advances in understanding of the epidemiology and immunopathogenesis of respiratory viral infection in asthma provide opportunities or identification of specific targets for antiviral agents and strategies for management and prevention.

This derailing of the immune system may result from false alarms generated by the innate immune system, resulting in unexpected dendritic cell (DC) maturation after exposure to allergens. Conditions in the local microenvironment during DC maturation may also result in the preferential induction of Th2 responses. Recent progress has been made in our understanding of the role of DCs in both Th2 sensitization to aeroallergens and the regulation of Th2 and Th1 immunity.

Previous studies had been conducted during the hot weather, none over the last 10 years, were carried out during, the milder weather we are experiencing. The aim of this study is to establish the pattern of admission during this mild weather and to elucidate the possible risk factors. Methods: A prospective study was performed in 4 hospitals in 2 different locations in Al-Mashaer, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected during one working shift in 2 hospitals in Arafat on the 9th of Dhul Hijjah 1422, corresponding to 21st of February 2002, and another working shift in 2 hospitals in Mina on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah 1422, corresponding to 22nd of February 2002. Results: A cohort of 76 patients from Arafat hospitals and 84 patients from Mina' hospitals were included (total 160 patients). Males constituted 62% and females 38% with the median age of 60 +/- 15years. The respiratory system was the most commonly affected (57%), followed by cardiovascular system (19.4%), and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in 6.3% of cases. There were only 3 cases of heat-related admissions with only one confirmed case of heat stroke. Similarly, only one case of meningitis was confirmed in this cohort. Pneumonia was encountered in 63 cases (39.4%) and exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) in 23 cases (14.4%). Pre-existing co-morbid medical conditions had included bronchial asthma and COPD (22.5%), hypertension (17.5%), and Diabetes mellitus (15%). Short-term follow up (24-48 hours) identified 2 deaths (1.3%), 94 patients (59%) were transferred to other secondary or tertiary care facilities and 64 (40%) were discharged home. Conclusion: Hospital admission during Hajj is related to old age and occurs in patients with associated co-morbid conditions. During this mild weather lower respiratory tract infections and exacerbation of bronchial asthma and COPD are the most commonly encountered diseases during Hajj.

This article reviews several environmental exposures and suggests whether they contribute to asthma prevalence, asthma exacerbations, or both. Outdoor air exposures and violence are not likely to cause the increase in asthma prevalence. Exposure to outdoor air pollutants primarily leads to increased exacerbations, sometimes manifested as asthma clusters. Clinicians should be alert for space-time clusters of asthma exacerbations in the community, because these clusters may suggest a modifiable point-source exposure. Indoor air exposures are more strongly linked to the increase in asthma prevalence. Exposure to dust mites and tobacco smoke are risk factors for the development of asthma and may also exacerbate existing asthma. Effective measures to prevent exposures to these pollutants are available. With proper management, the amount of environmental exposures can be decreased. Whether decreasing these exposures will result in decreases in asthma prevalence and exacerbations is not yet documented.

Methods: This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy with standardized ragweed pollen extract tablets, in patients with an allergic rhinitis. A total of 110 outpatients were randomized (immunotherapy [I]: 55; placebo [P]: 55), of whom 99 were analyzable for efficacy (I: 48; P: 51) and 106 analyzable for safety (I: 53; P: 53). After a 28-day progression phase, the patients received a maintenance treatment during 6.5 months. Efficacy variables included a global assessment of efficacy (patient/investigator), symptoms and medication scores as well as the frequency of asthma attacks. Results: In the active treatment group, 43 patients completed the study, versus 49 on placebo. During the whole period of pollination, the difference favoring immunotherapy was highly significant for the global assessment by the patient (p = 0.004) and by the investigator (p = 0.005). Adverse reactions were reported more often in the active treatment but mild or moderate, and they abated after dose adjustment. A subgroup analysis of those patients receiving the highest dose of immunotherapy (3 tablets 3 times a week) showed a highly significant response for rhinitis and conjunctivitis total scores by comparison to lower dosages. Conclusion: This study confirms the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy and strongly suggests a dose-response relationship. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

However, the direct effects of mycoplasma infection on asthma remain unknown. Using a murine allergic-asthma model, we evaluated the effects of different timing of airway Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), lung inflammation, and the protein levels of Th1 (gamma interferon [IFN-gamma]) and Th2 (interleukin 4 [IL-4]) cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. When mycoplasma infection occurred 3 days before allergen (ovalbumin) sensitization and challenge, the infection reduced the BHR and inflammatory-cell influx into the lung. This was accompanied by a significant induction of Th1 responses (increased IFN-gamma and decreased IL-4 production). Conversely, when mycoplasma infection occurred 2 days after allergen sensitization and challenge, the infection initially caused a temporary reduction of BHR and then increased BHR, lung inflammation, and IL-4 levels. Our data suggest that mycoplasma infection could modulate both physiological and immunological responses in the murine asthma model.

We as well as others have shown that the alpha(7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha(7) nAChR) regulates the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) in PNECs and SCLC. Serotonin is an autocrine growth factor for PNECs and SCLC and acts as bronchoconstrictor. We found that nicotine and its nitrosated carcinogenic derivative 4.(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) bind to the alpha(7) nAChR in SCLC and PNECs, resulting in the influx of Ca2+, release of 5-HT, and activation of a mitogenic pathway mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), Raf-1, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-myc. Exposure to 10% CO2 acted synergistically. Unstimulated SCLC cells from smokers demonstrated high base levels of 5-HT release and of individual downstream signaling components in comparison to PNECs. Subchronic exposure of PNECs to NNK up-regulated the alpha(7) nAChR and its associated serotonergic mitogenic pathway in PNECs, an effect that may contribute to the development of SCLC in smokers and pediatric asthma in children of mothers who smoke.

We have recently identified a new-type prostaglandin D2 receptor, named CRTH2. Studies with normal subjects have shown that CRTH2 appears to be selectively expressed by T helper 2 cells but not T helper 1 cells among circulating CD4(+) lymphocytes. The exact correlation between CRTH2 and T helper 2 cells in various disease settings and the impact of CRTH2-mediated prostaglandin D-2 activities on various T helper 2 responses in vivo still remain to be elucidated, however. In this study, we investigated the correlation between CRTH2 and T helper 2 cells among circulating CD4+ lymphocytes in normal adults and patients with atopic dermatitis, a T-helper-2-involving disease. The results showed that virtually all CRTH2(+)CD4(+) lymphocytes had a pure T helper 2 phenotype and formed not all but a large proportion of circulating T helper 2 cells for both normal and atopic dermatitis subjects. In chemotaxis assays, peripheral blood CRTH2(+)CD4(+) lymphocytes were significantly attracted by prostaglandin D2 as well as by a typical T-helper-2-attracting chemokine, thymus and activation regulated chemokine, whereas they showed little chemotactic migration toward typical T-helper-1-attracting chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta and interferon-gamma inducible protein 10. Furthermore, in atopic dermatitis patients, a preferential increase of CRTH2(+) cells was noted within the disease-related cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-positive, but not the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-negative, CD4(+) lymphocyte compartment. Our results suggest the involvement of the prostaglandin D-2/CRTH2 system in both normal and pathogenic T helper 2 responses.

In contrast to mouse models of atopic asthma, previous mouse models of diisocyanate-induced asthma have failed to show lung inflammation with characteristics of human disease. Objective: Our goal was to establish a novel mouse model of diisocyanate-induced asthma in which lung inflammation reminiscent of that seen in human asthma is generated after inhaled antigen challenge. Methods: BALB/c mice were epicutaneously sensitized to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and then challenged with an HDI-protein conjugate administered by means of an intranasal droplet. Results: HDI sensitization resulted in development of contact hypersensitivity and HDI-specific antibody production. Most importantly, however, vigorous inflammatory responses with characteristics of human asthma were generated in the lung after inhaled HDI challenge. Challenge of sensitized, but not unsensitized, mice resulted in airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and production of T(H)1-type (IFN-gamma) and T(H)2 type (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) cytokines by lung inflammatory cells. Despite the mixed T(H)1/T(H)2 response induced by HDI sensitization, use of cytokine-dericient mice revealed that airway eosinophilia was mediated by T(H)2 cytokines and not by IFN-gamma. Conclusion: We report a novel mouse model of diisocyanate-induced asthma that, in contrast to previous models, demonstrates antigen-induced lung inflammation with characteristics of human disease. This model will allow investigation of the immunopathogenesis of diisocyanate-induced asthma and should provide insight into this common form of occupational disease.

Although sulfite additives have been implicated as a major cause of wine induced asthma, direct evidence is limited. Two studies were undertaken to assess sulfite reactivity in wine sensitive asthmatics. The first study assessed sensitivity to sulfites in wine using a single dose sulfited wine challenge protocol followed by a double blind, placebo controlled challenge. In the second study a cumulative dose sulfited wine challenge protocol was employe to establish if wine sensitive asthmatics as a group have an increased sensitivity to sulfites. Methods-In study 1, 24 asthmatic patients with a strong history of wine induced asthma were screened. Subjects showing positive responses to single blind high sulfite (300 ppm) wine challenge were rechallenged on separate days in a double blind, placebo controlled fashion with wines of varying sulfite levels to characterise their responses to these drinks. In study 2, wine sensitive asthmatic patients (n=12) and control asthmatics (n=6) were challenged cumulatively with wine containing increasing concentrations of sulfite in order to characterise further their sensitivity to sulfites in wine. Results-Four of the 24 self-reporting wine sensitive asthmatic patients were found to respond to sulfite additives in wine when challenged in a single dose fashion (study 1). In the double blind dose-response study all four had a significant fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) (> 15% from baseline) following exposure to wine containing 300 ppm sulfite, but did not respond to wines containing 20, 75 or 150 ppm sulfite. Responses were maximal at 5 minutes (mean (SD) maximal decline in FEV, 28.7 (13)%) and took 15-60 minutes to return to baseline levels. In the cumulative dose-response study (study 2) no significant difference was observed in any of the lung function parameters measured (FEV,, peak expiratory flow (PEF), mid phase forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75)) between wine sensitive and normal asthmatic subjects. Conclusions-Only a small number of wine sensitive asthmatic patients responded to a single dose challenge with sulfited wine under laboratory conditions. This may suggest that the role of sulfites and/or wine in triggering asthmatic responses has been overestimated. Alternatively, cofactors or other components in wine may play an important role in wine induced asthma. Cumulative sulfite dose challenges did not detect an increased sensitivity to sulfite in wine sensitive asthmatics and an alternative approach to identifying sulfite/wine sensitive asthma may be required.

Methods: In a large British birth cohort of 4065 natural children of 2583 mothers, we investigated whether in utero and perinatal influences contribute to the development and the severity of asthma in childhood, allowing for possible confounders of the relationship, and considering the nonindependence of familial data. Results: Child asthma (10.1%) was more frequently reported by mothers when there had been health complications during pregnancy (prevalence = 14.3%; adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.67), labor, or delivery (19.3%, ORadj = 1.35, 1.01-1.81); child illness or health complications during the first week of life (22.6%, ORadj = 1.35, 1.01-1.82); and birth weight of < 2.5 kg (7.0%, ORadj = 1.57, 1.10-2.25). Specific causes of health complications during pregnancy which significantly related to asthma were early or threatened labor (ICD: 644) (4.8%, ORadj = 1.58, 1.03-2.40) and the malposition or malpresentation of the fetus (ICD: 652) (1.6%, ORadj = 3.63, 1.47-8.91). Conclusions: The results provide further evidence that in utero and perinatal factors may increase the risk of developing asthma.

Specific immunotherapy inhibits allergen-induced nasal eosinophilia. Objectives: We sought to assess, in the context of a randomized trial, the relationships between symptomatic improvement after immunotherapy and eosinophil numbers and IL-5 expression in the nasal mucosa during the pollen season. Methods: Nasal biopsy specimens were taken from 37 adults with severe summer hay fever at baseline (out of season) and at peak season after 2 years of treatment with a depot grass pollen extract or placebo. Biopsy specimens were processed for immunohistochemistry by using mAbs against eosinophils (EG2), T cells (CD3), and IL-2 receptor-positive cells (CD25), as well as for in situ hybridization by using a sulfur 35-labeled antisense riboprobe directed against IL-5. Results: Immunotherapy significantly reduced symptoms (49%, P = .01) and medication requirements (80%, P = .007) compared with placebo. There was a 400% increase (P = .004) in eosinophils during the pollen season in placebo-treated patients, which was inhibited in the immunotherapy group (20% increase, P = .04 between groups). Seasonal increases were also observed for CD25(+) cells (P = .002), CD3(+) cells (P = .02), and IL-5 mRNA-expressing cells (P = .03) in the placebo group but not in the immunotherapy group. A significant correlation was observed between eosinophils and IL-5 expression (r = 0.5, P < .05). Both eosinophils (r = 0.6, P < .02) and IL-5 (r = 0.6, P < .02) correlated with symptoms after immunotherapy. Conclusion: Improvement in symptoms after grass pollen immunotherapy may result, at least in part, from inhibition of IL-5-dependent tissue eosinophilia during the pollen season. Conclusion: Improvement in symptoms after grass pollen immunotherapy may result, at least in part, from inhibition of IL-5-dependent tissue eosinophilia during the pollen season.

Methods: During a period spanning 2 humid summers (May 1998 to October 1999), dust mite and allergen densities were determined in 3 groups of homes. One group (low RH group, n = 23) maintained an RN of less than 51%, Most of these homes used a high-efficiency dehumidifier and air conditioning. A second group of homes (group A) used air conditioning only (n = 19) or air conditioning and dehumidification (n = 5) but did not maintain an RH of less than 51%, A third group of homes (group C, n = 24) controlled climate by opening windows and had an RH of greater than 51%. Normal housecleaning was maintained in all homes during the study, Results: The low RH group homes started in June with a mean +/- SE of 401 +/- 124 live mites and 17 +/- 3 mug of total Der 1 allergen per gram of dust. After 17 months of maintaining an RH of less than 51%, these declined significantly to 8 +/- 3 live mites per gram LP =.004) and 4 +/- 1 mug of Der 1 per gram of dust (P <.001). In contrast, group A and C homes exhibited seasonal peaks of 500 to 1000 mites and 40 to 70 <mu>g of Der 1 per gram of dust At all time points after the baseline sample, the low RH group homes had significantly less (P <.001) allergen than the group A and C homes, After 17 months, allergen levels were more than 10 Limes lo,Per in low Rfi homes compared with humid homes, Conclusion: This study showed that it is practical to maintain an indoor RH of less than 51% during the humid summer season in a temperate climate, and this resulted in significant reductions in mite and allergen levels.

CC chemokines have been shown to play an important role in inflammation. We examined whether DEP could alter the production of CC chemokines by cells residing in the human nasal mucosa. At both 6 and 24 h following intranasal DEP challenge, the levels of nasal RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MCP-3 were significantly elevated compared to baseline. In contrast, DEP did not enhance levels of Eotaxin at any time, demonstrating that the action of DEP was not simply a global effect on all CC chemokines. Challenge with saline resulted in no significant change in expression of any chemokine at any time. Challenge with DEP also resulted in an increase in total cell counts in nasal lavage fluids. Increases in lymphocyte, monocyte/macrophage, and neutrophil cells were observed but there was no change in eosinophil cell numbers. In contrast, there was a significant enhancement of ECP protein levels in washes performed 6 to 24 h after DEP challenge. Elevated specific nasal chemokine expression following exposure to DEP likely participates in the inflammation, cellular infiltration, and increase in IgE observed in the absence of allergen.

Objectives: We sought to elaborate the relations between the occurrence of pregnancy complications and other pregnancy-related conditions and the risk of bronchial obstruction during the first 2 years of life and the occurrence of asthma and allergic rhinitis by the age of 4 years. Pregnancy complications were considered both as predictors of the health outcomes and as possible effects caused by other prenatal factors. Methods: A population-based, l-year, cohort study was carried out involving 2531 children horn in Oslo, Norway. We collected information on maternally related (hyperemesis, hypertension, and preeclampsia) and uterus-related complications in pregnancy (antepartum hemorrhage, preterm contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus) and the child's health and environmental exposures at birth and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and 4 years of age. The outcomes of interest were bronchial obstruction during the first 2 years and asthma and allergic rhinitis at the age of 4 years. Results: In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders, uterus-related, but not other pregnancy-related, complications increased the risk of bronchial obstruction (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1,3-3.4), asthma (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5.4), and allergic rhinitis (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.2). These relations were similar in children of atopic and nonatopic parents. Conclusions: Uterus-related complications in pregnancy increase the risk of having asthma and allergic rhinitis in childhood.

Cinnamaldehyde is a more potent skin sensitizer than cinnamic alcohol. It has been hypothesized that cinnamic alcohol is a "prohapten" that requires metabolic activation, presumably by oxidoreductase enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), to the protein-reactive cinnamaldehyde (a hapten). In this study, the in vitro percutaneous absorption and metabolism of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic alcohol (78 mu mol dose) has been examined using freshly excised, metabolically viable, full-thickness breast and abdomen skin from six female donors. Penetration rates and total cumulative recoveries of cinnamic compounds that were present in receptor fluid, extracted from within the skin, evaporated from the skin surface, or remained unabsorbed on the skin surface after 24 h were quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde to both cinnamic alcohol and cinnamic acid was observed. Topically applied cinnamic alcohol was converted to cinnamaldehyde (found on the skin surface only) and cinnamic acid. To establish whether these biotransformations were enzymatic, experiments were performed in the absence and presence of varying concentrations (80-320 mu mol) of the ADH/CYP2E1 inhibitors pyrazole: or 4-methylpyrazole. The observation that pyrazole significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the total penetration of cinnamic metabolites into receptor fluid, following either cinnamaldehyde or cinnamic alcohol treatment, but did not significantly affect parent chemical penetration, suggests that we are measuring cutaneous metabolic products of ADH activity. The skin absorption and metabolism of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic alcohol will play an important role in the manifestation of ACD following topical exposure to these compounds.

In vitro studies have shown that T-cell responses to these allergens do occur prenatally. Some allergens (milk proteins) appear to lead more often to fetal T-cell priming than others (house dust mite allergen, ovalbumin, and birch and grass pollen allergens). Objective: We sought to determine the window of opportunity for prenatal T-cell priming with inhalant and nutritive allergens. Methods: The T-cell reactivity of cord blood cells derived through cordocentesis from unborn (n = 62) and term babies (n = 114) in response to inhalant allergens (birch pollen major allergen, recombinant Bet v 1, and timothy grass major allergen, recombinant Phl p 1) was investigated. Results: The results demonstrate that allergen-specific T-cell reactivity is as common in preterm as in term infants (Bet v 1, 8% and 5%, respectively; Phl p 1, 20% and 25%, respectively). Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that differential handling of the allergenic proteins by the feto-placental barrier and possibly by antigen-presenting cells may directly modulate the ensuing T-cell immune response.
